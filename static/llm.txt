# Nillion Documentation

> Nillion is a decentralized computation platform that enables privacy-preserving operations through advanced cryptography. Our technology allows developers to build applications that process sensitive data without compromising privacy or security.

Nillion combines multiple cryptographic techniques to create a platform where data can remain private while still being useful for computation. Our suite of tools includes SecretVault for secure data storage and SecretLLM for private AI.
