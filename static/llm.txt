# Nillion Documentation

> Nillion is a decentralized computation platform that enables privacy-preserving operations through advanced cryptography. Our technology allows developers to build applications that process sensitive data without compromising privacy or security.

Nillion combines multiple cryptographic techniques to create a platform where data can remain private while still being useful for computation. Our suite of tools includes SecretVault for secure data storage, SecretLLM for private AI, SecretSigner for protected key operations, and nilVM for general-purpose privacy-preserving computation.
