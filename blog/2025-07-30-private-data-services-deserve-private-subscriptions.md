At Nillion, we set ourselves the challenge of building the blind computer, a computational stack that makes it easy for developers to build privacy-preserving apps. But as we developed our Private Storage and Private LLMs services, we faced a fundamental contradiction: how do you provide access to privacy first services without compromising privacy from the very first interaction?

The irony was glaring. Here we were, building technology that could process your data without ever seeing it, yet to use our services, you potentially still need to hand over your email, credit card details, and billing address just like every other API provider. For a privacy project, this felt fundamentally wrong, so we built our own solution.

## Breaking the Privacy Paradox

Traditional API subscriptions create an immediate privacy leak. Before you can even test whether a service protects your data, you've already surrendered your personal information to access it. Email addresses get stored, credit cards get processed, and billing addresses get recorded, all creating a digital paper trail that links your real identity to your usage patterns.

This approach made no sense for Nillion. We are privacy first, so the traditional methods of entering emails, addresses, and credit card numbers simply didn't make the cut. The solution? We introduced the NIL token and built a subscription system that aligns with our privacy principles from day one.

## How Privacy First Subscriptions Work

### Nillion API Portal

[@0ceans404](https://x.com/0ceans404) built the [Nillion API Portal](https://github.com/oceans404/nillion-api-portal) using the [@nillion/nuc library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nillion/nuc) to demonstrate this vision in action. The Portal lets you subscribe to our [nilDB](/build/private-storage/overview) (Private Storage) and [nilAI](/build/private-llms/overview) (Private LLMs) services without the typical web2 signup flow. No email registration, no credit card details, no billing address. Just connect your Nillion wallet and pay with NIL tokens.

Here's what changes when you put privacy first in your subscription model:

Your Nillion wallet handles both identity and payment in one step, creating a clean separation between your real world identity and your service usage.

## Building the Infrastructure for Private Computing

The Portal UI is just one implementation. Anyone can build their own subscription interface using the [@nillion/nuc library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nillion/nuc) and nilAuth service without needing our approval. This isn't about creating another payment processor. It's about establishing the infrastructure patterns that private computing needs to work at scale.

The nuc library handles all the blockchain interactions during signup, so developers don't need to worry about transaction details or gas management. After subscription, it's standard API integration, but with the crucial difference that no personal data was collected in the process.

## Naturally Enabling AI Agents

This privacy first approach opens up possibilities that traditional subscription models can't support. Because Nillion subscriptions don't require email verification, credit card authorization, or manual approval processes, they work naturally with AI agents.

An AI agent with a Nillion wallet can programmatically subscribe to services, get API keys, and start using Private Storage and Private LLMs, all without human intervention. This isn't just a technical convenience. It's a fundamental requirement for the autonomous, privacy preserving applications we're building toward.

## Beyond Subscriptions: Building the Privacy Stack

Private subscriptions are just one piece of building the blind computer. When your storage is private, your AI is private, and even your access to these services is private, you create an end to end privacy preserving computational environment. This matters because privacy isn't just about protecting existing workflows. It's about enabling entirely new categories of applications that simply can't exist when privacy leaks at any point in the stack.

The Portal demonstrates that privacy first service access is not only possible but practical. We've proven you can build developer friendly APIs without compromising on privacy principles from the very first interaction.
