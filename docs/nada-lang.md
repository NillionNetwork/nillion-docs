# Nada Language

## Overview

The Nillion Network leverages Nada, our MPC language, for defining MPC programs. Our initial implementation of Nada comes in the form of Nada, a Python DSL (Domain Specific Language).

The Nada language is:
- **Strongly typed:** every variable and expression has a specific type that is checked at compile time to prevent common errors such as type mismatches.
- **Correctness-oriented:** Nada has features including type-checking and static analysis built into the compiler.
- **Compiled:** Nada is a compiled language with different stages.
