Today Nillion SDK binaries are available for Mac and Linux. In order to install Nillion on a Windows machine, you'll need to first complete a 5 minute WSL developer environment setup. Follow the steps below to install WSL, set up your WSL developer environment, and install and use Nillion Linux binaries from a Windows machine.

#### WSL developer environment setup

The [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (WSL) lets developers install a Linux distribution and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools including the [Nillion SDK and tools](/nillion-sdk-and-tools) on a Windows machine.

#### 1. Run the install command

From your terminal, install WSL

```
wsl --install
```

This downloads and installs the Ubuntu Linux distribution.

#### 2. Restart your computer

A reboot is required after installing Ubuntu.

#### 3. After restarting, open Ubuntu and create an account

To open an Ubuntu terminal, search for the app from Start. Open Ubuntu and follow the prompts to set up your Linux username and password.

#### 4. Update and upgrade packages

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

#### 5. Install the Visual Studio Code Remote Development Extension

Visual Studio Code Remote Development allows you to use a container, remote machine, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as a full-featured development environment. [Install the Visual Studio Code Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).

#### 6. Open a new Ubuntu terminal and Install Nillion

Now that your WSL development environment is set up, you can install the Nillion SDK and Tools.

:::info
Make sure to install Nillion within **a new Ubuntu terminal.** Either open an Ubuntu terminal, or from your Windows PowerShell terminal, first run Ubuntu:

```
ubuntu
```

ðŸŽ‰ Great work! You've set up a WSL environment and installed Nillion within that environment. Before running a nillion command like `nillion-devnet`, `nada`, or `pynadac` make sure you are in a WSL environment by first running ubuntu:

```
ubuntu
```
