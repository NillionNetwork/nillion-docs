#### 1. Install [nilup](/nilup), the [Nillion SDK tool](/nillion-sdk-and-tools#nillion-sdk-tools) installer and version manager.

:::info
Nillion SDK binaries are available for [Linux and macOS platforms](/limitations#platforms). For Windows installation, make sure to follow our [Windows developer environment setup](/installation#windows-guide) guide ahead of installing binaries.
:::
_For the security-conscious, please download the `install.sh` script, so that you can inspect how
it works, before piping it to `bash`._

```bash
curl https://nilup.nilogy.xyz/install.sh | bash
```

The install script installs `nilup` and the latest version of the SDK. Close your terminal. Open a
new terminal and confirm both `nilup` and `nillion` are installed:

```bash
nilup -V; nillion -V

// Your output should be similar to the below
nilup v0.9.0
nillion v0.9.0
```
