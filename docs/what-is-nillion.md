# What is Nillion

Nillion is a secure computation network that decentralizes trust for high-value, sensitive, and private data in the same way that blockchains decentralize transactions.

## Intro to Nillion

Nillion is a decentralized data storage and computation network and an accompanying a suite of tools that together allow builders to build novel, powerful applications that leverage high-value data in a safer way. Its modular and flexible architecture makes it possible to leverage cutting-edge cryptographic techniques to accomplish this, enabling both more secure versions of existing workflows and unlocking new opportunities. Early builders in the Nillion community are creating tooling for private predictive AI, secure storage and compute solutions for healthcare, storage solutions for secure data such as credentials, and secure workflows for trade data.

## What is Blind Computation

When sensitive data is encrypted and stored, the traditional approaches to doing useful work with that data involve decrypting it in order perform any necessary computations (and then potentially re-encrypting the results). This decrypt-compute-re-encrypt cycle not only exposes the data to the operators of the computing infrastructure. Blind computation makes it possible to perform useful work on data *while it remains encrypted*, even if the operator of the computing infrastructure does not possess the ability to decrypt it.

## What are Blind Modules

Nillion makes blind computation possible by leveraging a number of *privacy-enhancing technologies* (PETs) such as secure multi-party computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE). Each blind module packages and combines one or more PETs in a developer-friendly way, bringing these capabilities to a broader audience.
