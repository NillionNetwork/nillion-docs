# Permissions and Payments

NUCs and nilAuth provide the access control layer of the Blind Computer, allowing data owners to define, delegate, and revoke permissions over their data.

Built on an extension of [UCAN](https://ucan.xyz/), this framework supports user-originated, cryptographically signed policies for read, write, and compute access. Permissions are enforced at the system level, without relying on centralized coordination.

To get started with NUCs, see [Network API Access](/build/network-api-access).
