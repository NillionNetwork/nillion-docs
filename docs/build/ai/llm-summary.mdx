# About

### What is Nillion

Nillion is a secure computation network that decentralizes trust for high-value, sensitive, and private data via Private Enhancing Technologies (PETs) in the same way that blockchains decentralize transactions.

### What is Blind Computation

When sensitive data is encrypted and stored, the traditional approaches to doing useful work with that data involve decrypting it in order to perform any necessary computations (and then potentially re-encrypting the results). This decrypt-compute-re-encrypt cycle not only exposes the data to the operators of the computing infrastructure. Blind computation makes it possible to perform useful work on data while it remains encrypted, even if the operator of the computing infrastructure does not possess the ability to decrypt it.

### Architecture

- Petnet: Network of nodes that can be recruited into clusters by builders (depending on which PET they employ). The Petnet nodes support secure storage and computation over data, and these capabilities can be leveraged using the variety of SDKs that can be used to interact with the nodes. Each node supports the use of PETs by operating one or more Blind Modules.
- nilChain: Blockchain that manages shared resources for the whole Nillion Network. It's built on top of the Cosmos SDK stack and supports rewards, cryptoeconomic stake, and governance, as well as enabling inter-cluster coordination. Since its main purpose is to enable coordination, the chain does not have an open execution environment for running smart contracts.

### What are Blind Modules

Nillion makes blind computation possible by leveraging a number of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as secure multi-party computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE). Each blind module packages and combines one or more PETs in a developer-friendly way, bringing these capabilities to a broader audience.

//TODO: Add Mermaid Diagram

- nilDB

nilDB is Nillion's secure database solution, enabling data to be stored in an encrypted (via symmetric cryptography or HE) and/or decentralized (via MPC) way. Data is stored on a cluster of network nodes (with the current cluster consisting of three nodes).
nilDB is the Blind Module that underpins Nillion's SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics products. SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics data are accessed via an easy-to-use RESTful API with endpoints to create/upload, retrieve, and query data. Developers can use our nilQL library to encrypt and/or secret share data on the client side before using our RESTful API to send the ciphertexts and/or secret shares to the nodes.

```

```

- nilAI

nilAI is Nillion's secure AI offering, which runs LLMs securely inside TEEs. nilAI is the Blind Module that underpins SecretLLM.
Like SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics, this SDK can be accessed via an easy-to-use RESTful API that allows users to run inference using supported models.

//TODO: Add Mermaid Diagram

- nilVM

The core functionality provided by nilVM is the ability to sign data in a decentralized way using MPC, which can be leveraged using SecretSigner.
nilVM can also be leveraged using our Python or TypeScript clients and includes the Nada programming language.

### Privacy-Enhancing Technologies

The Blind Modules leverage a number of PETs to enable secure data storage and processing.

Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
nilDB supports the use of additive secret sharing to store data and to compute over that data. Builders can choose two or more nodes across which data would be stored using this approach.

nilVM supports the use of a number of MPC protocols, including threshold secret sharing schemes. Most notably, it relies on an integrated implementation of CGGMP21 to enable threshold secure signing of messages.

Homomorphic Encryption (HE)
nilDB supports of the use of the Paillier cryptosystem to store data, compute over that data, and retrieve results while relying on a single-node cluster. This makes it possible to perform aggregation queries over encrypted data even when using a single-node cluster.

Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
Private LLM inference and the use of private RAG is supported via TEEs.

### Core Offerings

- SecretLLM: Decentralized storage system that keeps sensitive data secret by storing encrypted shares across a cluster of nilDB nodes. Each nilDB node stores a separate share of the encrypted data, ensuring no single node can reveal the original value.
- SecretVault: OpenAI-compatible APIs that run AI models to provide private inference within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- SecretSigner: Uses threshold ECDSA to enable secure message and transaction signing while keeping your private keys secret within the Nillion Network.

### UseCases

- Secure Storage: Store and retrieve secrets on the Nillion Network via RESTful APIs
- Private Inference: Make private LLM calls to any application via a RESTful API.
- Signatures: Signing operations without relying on a trusted party
- RAG: Provide accuration information with source attribution ontop of SecretVauls and SecretLLM

Early builders in the Nillion community are creating tooling for private predictive AI, secure storage and compute solutions for healthcare, storage solutions for secure data such as credentials, and secure workflows for trade data.

# Build

## SecretVault

SecretVault lets you store sensitive data securely by encrypting and splitting it across multiple nodes. While regular fields remain readable, private information is protected through encryption - making it perfect for applications that need to balance data accessibility with privacy.

### Key Concepts

- Organization: Your root entity in SecretVault. When created, receives organization credentials and details (endpoints and dids) for the cluster of nodes for storage.
- Cluster: A group of nodes configured for your organization. All your data is stored across these nodes.
- Node: An endpoint where collection data is stored. Each node in your cluster stores all plaintext field values for your collections, holds one share of any encrypted field value, is uniquely identified by its DID (Decentralized Identifier), which is required for generating API tokens and accessing the node and Nodes require API tokens for authorization. These tokens are node-specific and must be included in your requests to interact with the node.
- Node API Tokens / Bearer Tokens: Bearer tokens, implemented as JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), are used to authenticate and authorize API calls to nodes. Each token is:
  - Node-Specific: Generated for a specific node using its DID
  - Secure: Signed with your organizationâ€™s private key
  - Temporary: Includes an expiration time (exp) for added security
- Collection: A table or container of SecretVault records. Created with an owner (your organization's DID), a schema defining the collection's structure
- Schema: A JSON Schema defines the immutable structure of records in a collection including:
  Field names
  Field data types (string, number, etc.)
  Required fields
  Field formats (uuid, date-time, etc.)
  Whether additional fields are allowed
- Record: A single data entry that follows a collection's schema. When a record is stored:
  Every node in the cluster stores the complete record
  Unencrypted field values are identically stored in plaintext across nodes
  Encrypted field values are different on each node (each node stores a different share)
- Field: A property defined in a schema. Each field has:
  A name (e.g., username, password)
  A data type (e.g., string)
  Optional formats or rules
  -Field Data: Data stored in a field. Data can be:
- Unencrypted: stored as plaintext, same value on all nodes
- Encrypted: split into shares by nilQL; each node stores a separate share

### Getting Started / Quickstart

1. Register an Organization
   Access the SecretVault Registration Portal via https://sv-sda-registration.replit.app/
   Register your organization by providing a name
   Select your preferred nilDB nodes - this defaults to the cluster config of demo nodes

Public Demo Node Cluster Configuration
The following nodes are available in the public demo cluster configuration. Each node provides its connection details and a Swagger UI (API docs) where you can explore and test the node's API endpoints.

Demo node 1: nildb-nx8v
URL: https://nildb-nx8v.nillion.network
DID: did:nil:testnet:nillion1qfrl8nje3nvwh6cryj63mz2y6gsdptvn07nx8v
Public Key: 034a2df3bafaca2aa0b70353aa2f05ad129096b60c8a305d115bf605d57bc2588a
API docs: https://nildb-nx8v.nillion.network/api/v1/openapi/docs/

Demo node 2: nildb-p3mx

URL: https://nildb-rugk.nillion.network
DID: did:nil:testnet:nillion1kfremrp2mryxrynx66etjl8s7wazxc3rssrugk
Public Key: 02c4a5c6135098dd7ac1186c13d4de466be85f85efc6961e75abc31e4fdac41528
API docs: https://nildb-rugk.nillion.network/api/v1/openapi/docs/

2. Define a Collection
   To store data in SecretVault, you'll need to define a Collection with a JSON Schema, which creates a structured container for your records (individual pieces of data). This has two main effects:

Creates a Collection in SecretVault for your data
Links the Collection to your Organization and validates all records before storage, ensuring they adhere to the JSON Schema
You can create schema collections using the SecretVault Tools UI or programatically:

We recommened the Schema Tools for ease of use via https://schema-tools.vercel.app/

You can:

- Use a Schema template
- Create your ownb
- Upload an exisitng one

Then validate + upload it. Then see the `collection` in the Collection Tab page.

//TODO: Add Vanilla

3. Store Records
   First, encrypt any private data fields with nilQL.

Then upload the record to all nodes in your cluster to store the record. Plaintext fields are stored identically across all nodes, while encrypted fields are split into unique shares, with each node holding one share to keep data secure.

4. Retrieve Records
   Read or retrieve a record by fetching the data from all nodes in your cluster. Decrypt private data fields with nilQL to recombine shares from all nodes and reconstruct the original data.

## SecretLLM

SecretLLM is a set of OpenAI-compatible APIs that run AI models within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). You can use SecretLLM to build new private AI applications or migrate existing ones to run in a secure SecretLLM environment where your data remains private.

### Available models

- meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct: 3 Billion Parameter Model for quick responses, simple Q&A, basic chat. Faster inference with lower resource usage.
- meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct: 8 Billion Parameter Model for ore complex tasks, detailed responses, code generation. Higher quality but slower inference.

### Key Features

- Drop-in Privacy: Keep your OpenAI-style code, just point it to SecretLLM
- Privacy Through TEEs: All processing happens within a TEE, built on NVIDIA Confidential Computing
- Standard Security: HTTPS encryption provides end-to-end protection for all data in transit between your application and the TEE environment
- Cryptographic Attestation: Verify the integrity of your TEE environment through our attestation API
- Signed Responses: Every model response includes a cryptographic signature for verification

### Attestation & Verification

SecretLLM provides two layers of cryptographic proof:

1. Environment Attestation: Verify your TEE's integrity through the attestation endpoint, including GPU environment verification and Service verification through a verifying key
2. Response Signatures: Every chat completion response includes a cryptographic signature, allowing you to verify that the response came from the attested environment.

### Getting Started / Quickstart

0. Use the nilAI Registration Page for an API Key: https://nillion.pub/nilai-registration-page/
1. Send your prompt to SecretLLM over HTTPS (just like any secure web request)
2. Your prompt runs inside a Trusted Execution Environment where it is hidden from the cloud provider
3. Get your result back over HTTPS, complete with a cryptographic signature

Examples:

```javascript (node)
const OpenAI = require('openai');
require('dotenv').config();

// Initialize the OpenAI client
// baseURL is the nilAI node url: https://docs.nillion.com/network#nilai-nodes
// apiKey is your nilAI node api key: https://docs.nillion.com/build/secretLLM/access
const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://nilai-a779.nillion.network/v1',
  apiKey: process.env.NILAI_API_KEY || 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
});

async function generateText() {
  try {
    const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'system',
          content: 'You are a fitness coach.',
        },
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: 'What is better for you, salad or pizza?',
        },
      ],
      stream: false,
    });

    // Every SecretLLM response includes a cryptographic signature for verification
    console.log(`Signature: ${response.signature}`);
    console.log(`Response: ${response.choices[0].message.content}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

generateText();
```

```python

from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the OpenAI client

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://nilai-<node>.nillion.network/v1/",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
)

# Send a chat completion request

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is your name?"
        }
    ],
    stream=False
)

```

```javascript
// nextjs app / api router
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  try {
    const body = await req.json();

    const response = await fetch(
      `${process.env.NILAI_API_URL}/v1/chat/completions`,
      {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.NILAI_API_KEY}`,
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          model: 'meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct',
          messages: body.messages,
          temperature: 0.2,
        }),
      }
    );

    const data = await response.json();
    return NextResponse.json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Chat error:', error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Failed to process chat request' },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```
