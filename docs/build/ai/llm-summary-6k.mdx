# About

### What is Nillion

Nillion is a secure computation network that decentralizes trust for high-value, sensitive, and private data using Private Enhancing Technologies (PETs), similar to how blockchains decentralize transactions.

### What is Blind Computation

Blind computation allows useful work to be performed on data while it remains encrypted, without exposing the data to the computing infrastructure operators. This contrasts with traditional methods that require decryption before computation, exposing sensitive information.

### Architecture

- **Petnet**: A network of nodes that form clusters to support secure data storage and computation using various PETs via Blind Modules.
- **nilChain**: A blockchain built on Cosmos SDK that manages shared resources, rewards, cryptoeconomic stake, and governance for the Nillion Network, enabling inter-cluster coordination. It does not have an open execution environment for smart contracts.

### What are Blind Modules

Nillion's Blind Modules leverage and combine privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) like secure multi-party computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE) to make blind computation accessible to developers.

**Modules:**

- **nilDB**: Nillion's secure database solution for encrypted and/or decentralized data storage on a cluster of nodes. It underpins **SecretVault** and **SecretDataAnalytics**, accessible via a RESTful API. Data can be encrypted/secret-shared client-side using `nilQL`.

  - _Data Flow Summary_: An application uses `nilQL` to secret share data, sending shares to multiple `nilDB` nodes. When querying, `nilQL` sends query shares to `nilDB` nodes, which reply with result shares that `nilQL` then reconstructs.

- **nilAI**: Nillion's secure AI offering, running LLMs securely within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). It underpins **SecretLLM**, accessible via a RESTful API for private inference.

  - _Data Flow Summary_: A user client sends an encrypted prompt to a `nilAI` node, where an LLM inside a TEE processes it (potentially with encrypted data from a `nilDB` cluster) and returns an encrypted reply to the user.

### Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)

Blind Modules utilize several PETs for secure data handling:

- **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**: `nilDB` uses additive secret sharing for data storage and computation.
- **Homomorphic Encryption (HE)**: `nilDB` supports the Paillier cryptosystem for single-node aggregation queries over encrypted data.
- **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**: Used in `nilAI` to support private LLM inference and private RAG.

### Core Offerings

- **SecretVault**: Decentralized storage system storing encrypted shares of sensitive data across `nilDB` nodes, ensuring no single node can reveal the original value.
- **SecretLLM**: OpenAI-compatible APIs running AI models within TEEs for private inference.

### Use Cases

- **Secure Storage**: Store and retrieve secrets via RESTful APIs.
- **Private Inference**: Make private LLM calls to any application via a RESTful API.
- **RAG**: Provide accurate information with source attribution on top of SecretVault and SecretLLM.

Early builders are creating tools for private predictive AI, secure storage/compute for healthcare, credential storage, and secure trade data workflows.

# Build

## SecretVault

SecretVault allows secure storage of sensitive data by encrypting and splitting it across multiple nodes. Plaintext fields remain readable, while private information is protected.

### Key Concepts

- **Organization**: Your root entity in SecretVault, receiving credentials and node details.
- **Cluster**: A group of nodes configured for your organization, where data is stored.
- **Node**: An endpoint storing collection data. Each node holds plaintext field values and one share of encrypted field values. Requires API tokens for authorization.
- **Node API Tokens / Bearer Tokens**: JWTs used for authentication, node-specific, signed with your organizationâ€™s private key, and temporary.
- **Collection**: A table or container of SecretVault records, created with an owner and a schema defining its structure.
- **Schema**: A JSON Schema defining the immutable structure of records, including field names, types, required fields, formats, and whether additional fields are allowed.
- **Record**: A single data entry conforming to a collection's schema. Unencrypted fields are stored identically; encrypted fields are stored as different shares on each node.
- **Field**: A property defined in a schema. Can be **Unencrypted** (plaintext) or **Encrypted** (split into shares by `nilQL`).

### Getting Started / Quickstart

Building a SecretVault app (Python or JS) involves these crucial steps:

1.  **Register an Organization**: Access the SecretVault Registration Portal at https://sv-sda-registration.replit.app/, provide a name, and select `nilDB` nodes. Public demo node details are available there.
2.  **Define a Collection**:
    - Define a JSON Schema for your data. Each record needs a unique `_id` (UUID format). Fields to be encrypted use `%share` or `%allot` syntax.
    - **Recommended**: Use the Schema Tools UI at https://schema-tools.vercel.app/ to create, validate, and upload your schema.
    - Alternatively, programmatically create the JSON Schema (draft-07, type "array" with items of type "object") and upload it to each node using the `Create Schema API`.
    - _Example Schema Snippet (showing `%share` for encryption):_
      ```json
      {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "_id": { "type": "string", "format": "uuid", "coerce": true },
          "years_in_web3": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": { "%share": { "type": "string" } },
            "required": ["%share"]
          }
          // ... other fields
        }
      }
      ```
    - _Example POST `Create Schema` Payload Snippet:_
      ```json
      {
        "_id": "YOUR_COLLECTION_UUID",
        "name": "Web3 Experience Survey",
        "keys": ["_id"],
        "schema": {
          "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
          "title": "Web3 Experience Survey",
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            /* ... your schema items ... */
          }
        }
      }
      ```
3.  **Store Records**:
    - First, encrypt any private data fields using `nilQL`.
    - Get your collection's Schema ID (via `GET /schemas`).
    - Prepare your data, ensuring it matches the schema and includes a unique `_id`.
    - Upload the data to all nodes using each node's `Upload/Create Data` endpoint (`POST /data/create`) with valid API tokens.
    - _Example POST `data/create` Payload Snippet:_
      ```json
      {
        "schema": "YOUR_SCHEMA_ID",
        "data": [
          {
            "_id": "YOUR_RECORD_UUID_1",
            "years_in_web3": "zKH1L", // encrypted share
            "responses": [{ "rating": 5, "question_number": 1 }]
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
4.  **Retrieve Records**:
    - Get your collection's Schema ID.
    - Retrieve records from a collection by calling the `Read Data` endpoint (`POST /data/read`) with the schema ID and an optional filter.
    - Decrypt private data fields with `nilQL` to reconstruct original data from shares.
    - _Example POST `/data/read` Payload Snippet:_
      ```json
      {
        "schema": "YOUR_SCHEMA_ID",
        "filter": { "_id": "YOUR_RECORD_UUID" }
      }
      ```
    - Other operations (`Update`, `Delete`, `Flush`, `Tail`) are also available; check https://docs.nillion.com/api/nildb/overview.
5.  **Define a Query | Data Analytics**:
    - Define an enhanced MongoDB aggregation pipeline to run analytics. Queries support variables and can operate on plaintext data or specific encrypted data types.
    - For encrypted data, `STORE` option allows retrieval as-is, while `SUM` option allows summation directly on encrypted shares.
    - Use the `Create Query API` (`POST /queries`) to register your query, providing a query name/description, a UUID4 for the Query ID, and the schema ID.
    - _Example `POST /queries` Payload Snippet (SUM query with variables):_
      ```json
      {
        "_id": "YOUR_QUERY_UUID",
        "name": "Sum years in Web3 for question X",
        "schema": "YOUR_SCHEMA_ID",
        "variables": {
          "question_number": { "type": "number", "description": "..." }
        },
        "pipeline": [
          /* ... MongoDB aggregation pipeline ... */
        ]
      }
      ```
6.  **Execute a Query | Data Analytics**:
    - Get your Query ID (via `GET /queries`).
    - Execute the query via the `Execute Query` endpoint (`POST /queries/execute`) using the query ID and any required variables.
    - _Example `POST /queries/execute` Payload Snippet:_
      ```json
      {
        "id": "YOUR_QUERY_ID",
        "variables": { "question_number": 5 }
      }
      ```

**Opinionated: Next.js + JavaScript + app router app**
For a Next.js guestbook app with SecretVault integration, you'll use `secretvaults` (a wrapper over `nilQL`). The core logic involves initializing `SecretVaultWrapper` with your organization configuration and schema ID, then calling `writeToNodes` to store data and `readFromNodes` to retrieve it. For encrypted fields, use the `"%allot"` syntax within your data structure.

Refer to the `nildb` folder in the `blind-module-examples` repository at https://github.com/NillionNetwork/blind-module-examples for complete code examples demonstrating these operations, including how to handle encrypted fields in a Next.js API route.

## SecretLLM

SecretLLM provides OpenAI-compatible APIs to run AI models within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), enabling private AI applications.

### Available models

- `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`: For quick responses, simple Q&A.
- `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`: For more complex tasks, detailed responses, code generation.

### Key Features

- **Drop-in Privacy**: Point existing OpenAI-style code to SecretLLM.
- **Privacy Through TEEs**: All processing occurs within TEEs using NVIDIA Confidential Computing.
- **Standard Security**: HTTPS encryption for data in transit.
- **Cryptographic Attestation**: Verify TEE integrity via the attestation API.
- **Signed Responses**: Every model response includes a cryptographic signature for verification.

### Attestation & Verification

SecretLLM offers two layers of cryptographic proof:

1.  **Environment Attestation**: Verify TEE integrity (including GPU and service verification) via the `/v1/attestation/report` endpoint.
2.  **Response Signatures**: Each chat completion response has a signature, proving it originated from the attested environment.

### Getting Started / Quickstart

1.  Obtain an API Key from the nilAI Registration Page: https://nillion.pub/nilai-registration-page/
2.  Send your prompt to SecretLLM over HTTPS.
3.  Your prompt runs securely inside a TEE.
4.  Receive your result over HTTPS, including a cryptographic signature.

_Example Usage (Conceptual):_
You can integrate SecretLLM using standard OpenAI client libraries (e.g., `openai` for Node.js or Python) by setting the `baseURL` to the nilAI node URL and providing your API key. You then call `client.chat.completions.create` with your chosen model and messages. The response will include a `signature` field.

For full code examples in JavaScript (Node.js, Next.js API routes) and Python, please refer to the `nilai` folder in the `blind-module-examples` repository: https://github.com/NillionNetwork/blind-module-examples.

### API usage

- `/v1/chat/completions` (POST): Generating AI responses.
- `/v1/models` (GET): Listing available models.
- `/v1/attestation/report` (GET): Getting cryptographic proof of environment.
- `/v1/usage` (GET): Tracking token usage.
- `/v1/health` (GET): Checking service status.

All `POST` endpoints require a JSON body and `Bearer Token` in the `Authorization` header. `GET` endpoints require the `Bearer Token` for authorization, except for `/v1/health`.

## Libraries

### nilQL

nilQL (Nillion Query Library) is a cryptographic library for secure data operations, especially for encrypting data stored in SecretVault and enabling secure operations within `nilDB` queries.

**Usage**:

- **Standalone**: Use as a general-purpose encryption/decryption library.
- **With SecretVault/SecretDataAnalytics**: Encrypt record field values with your organization's private key before storage. Query `nilQL` encrypted data to perform secure operations via SecretDataAnalytics APIs. This can be done directly with `nilQL` or via the `secretvaults` package (JS/Python wrappers).

**Implementations**:

- `nilql-ts`: TypeScript library for web and Node.js (`pnpm install @nillion/nilql`)
- `nilql-py`: Python library for server-side applications (`pip install nilql`)
- `secretvaults` (JS/Python): Wrapper packages for simplified integration with `nilQL` & SecretVault.

**Supported Operations (with data types and characteristics)**:

- **Store Single**: XSalsa20 + Poly1305 MAC; 32-bit integer, UTF-8 string (max 4096 bytes).
- **Match Single**: Deterministic salted SHA-512 hashing; 32-bit integer, UTF-8 string (max 4096 bytes).
- **Sum Single**: Non-deterministic Paillier (2048-bit primes); 32-bit signed integer.
- **Store Multiple**: XOR-based secret sharing; 32-bit integer, UTF-8 string (max 4096 bytes).
- **Match Multiple**: Deterministic salted SHA-512 hashing; 32-bit integer, UTF-8 string (max 4096 bytes).
- **Sum Multiple**: Additive secret sharing (modulus 2^32); 32-bit signed integer.

**Reference**:
Check these libraries for detailed usage and examples:

- https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nilql-ts for TypeScript
- https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nilql-py for Python

### Encrypt and decrypt data

`nilQL` is used to encrypt data by secret sharing it across selected nodes.
You can use `nilQL.encrypt()` to encrypt data and `nilQL.decrypt()` to decrypt shares, typically after generating a `ClusterKey` based on your cluster configuration and desired operations (e.g., `store: true`).

For comprehensive code examples on using `nilQL` to encrypt and decrypt data in Python and JavaScript/TypeScript, please refer to the respective `nilql-py` and `nilql-ts` repositories linked above.
