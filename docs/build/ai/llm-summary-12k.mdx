# About

### What is Nillion

Nillion is a secure computation network that decentralizes trust for high-value, sensitive, and private data via Private Enhancing Technologies (PETs) in the same way that blockchains decentralize transactions.

### What is Blind Computation

When sensitive data is encrypted and stored, the traditional approaches to doing useful work with that data involve decrypting it in order to perform any necessary computations (and then potentially re-encrypting the results). This decrypt-compute-re-encrypt cycle not only exposes the data to the operators of the computing infrastructure. Blind computation makes it possible to perform useful work on data while it remains encrypted, even if the operator of the computing infrastructure does not possess the ability to decrypt it.

### Architecture

- Petnet: Network of nodes that can be recruited into clusters by builders (depending on which PET they employ). The Petnet nodes support secure storage and computation over data, and these capabilities can be leveraged using the variety of SDKs that can be used to interact with the nodes. Each node supports the use of PETs by operating one or more Blind Modules.
- nilChain: Blockchain that manages shared resources for the whole Nillion Network. It's built on top of the Cosmos SDK stack and supports rewards, cryptoeconomic stake, and governance, as well as enabling inter-cluster coordination. Since its main purpose is to enable coordination, the chain does not have an open execution environment for running smart contracts.

### What are Blind Modules

Nillion makes blind computation possible by leveraging a number of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as secure multi-party computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE). Each blind module packages and combines one or more PETs in a developer-friendly way, bringing these capabilities to a broader audience.
Modules

- nilDB

nilDB is Nillion's secure database solution, enabling data to be stored in an encrypted (via symmetric cryptography or HE) and/or decentralized (via MPC) way. Data is stored on a cluster of network nodes (with the current cluster consisting of three nodes).
nilDB is the Blind Module that underpins Nillion's SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics products. SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics data are accessed via an easy-to-use RESTful API with endpoints to create/upload, retrieve, and query data. Developers can use our nilQL library to encrypt and/or secret share data on the client side before using our RESTful API to send the ciphertexts and/or secret shares to the nodes.

```

- nilAI

nilAI is Nillion's secure AI offering, which runs LLMs securely inside TEEs. nilAI is the Blind Module that underpins SecretLLM.
Like SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics, this SDK can be accessed via an easy-to-use RESTful API that allows users to run inference using supported models.

- nilVM

The core functionality provided by nilVM is the ability to sign data in a decentralized way using MPC, which can be leveraged using SecretSigner.
nilVM can also be leveraged using our Python or TypeScript clients and includes the Nada programming language.

```

### Privacy-Enhancing Technologies

The Blind Modules leverage a number of PETs to enable secure data storage and processing.

Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
nilDB supports the use of additive secret sharing to store data and to compute over that data. Builders can choose two or more nodes across which data would be stored using this approach.

nilVM supports the use of a number of MPC protocols, including threshold secret sharing schemes. Most notably, it relies on an integrated implementation of CGGMP21 to enable threshold secure signing of messages.

Homomorphic Encryption (HE)
nilDB supports of the use of the Paillier cryptosystem to store data, compute over that data, and retrieve results while relying on a single-node cluster. This makes it possible to perform aggregation queries over encrypted data even when using a single-node cluster.

Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
Private LLM inference and the use of private RAG is supported via TEEs.

### Core Offerings

- SecretLLM: Decentralized storage system that keeps sensitive data secret by storing encrypted shares across a cluster of nilDB nodes. Each nilDB node stores a separate share of the encrypted data, ensuring no single node can reveal the original value.
- SecretVault: OpenAI-compatible APIs that run AI models to provide private inference within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- SecretSigner: Uses threshold ECDSA to enable secure message and transaction signing while keeping your private keys secret within the Nillion Network.

### UseCases

- Secure Storage: Store and retrieve secrets on the Nillion Network via RESTful APIs
- Private Inference: Make private LLM calls to any application via a RESTful API.
- Signatures: Signing operations without relying on a trusted party
- RAG: Provide accurate information with source attribution on top of SecretVault and SecretLLM

Early builders in the Nillion community are creating tooling for private predictive AI, secure storage and compute solutions for healthcare, storage solutions for secure data such as credentials, and secure workflows for trade data.

# Build

## SecretVault

SecretVault lets you store sensitive data securely by encrypting and splitting it across multiple nodes. While regular fields remain readable, private information is protected through encryption - making it perfect for applications that need to balance data accessibility with privacy.

### Key Concepts

- Organization: Your root entity in SecretVault. When created, receives organization credentials and details (endpoints and dids) for the cluster of nodes for storage.
- Cluster: A group of nodes configured for your organization. All your data is stored across these nodes.
- Node: An endpoint where collection data is stored. Each node in your cluster stores all plaintext field values for your collections, holds one share of any encrypted field value, is uniquely identified by its DID (Decentralized Identifier), which is required for generating API tokens and accessing the node and Nodes require API tokens for authorization. These tokens are node-specific and must be included in your requests to interact with the node.
- Node API Tokens / Bearer Tokens: Bearer tokens, implemented as JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), are used to authenticate and authorize API calls to nodes. Each token is:
  - Node-Specific: Generated for a specific node using its DID
  - Secure: Signed with your organization’s private key
  - Temporary: Includes an expiration time (exp) for added security
- Collection: A table or container of SecretVault records. Created with an owner (your organization's DID), a schema defining the collection's structure
- Schema: A JSON Schema defines the immutable structure of records in a collection including:
  Field names
  Field data types (string, number, etc.)
  Required fields
  Field formats (uuid, date-time, etc.)
  Whether additional fields are allowed
- Record: A single data entry that follows a collection's schema. When a record is stored:
  Every node in the cluster stores the complete record
  Unencrypted field values are identically stored in plaintext across nodes
  Encrypted field values are different on each node (each node stores a different share)
- Field: A property defined in a schema. Each field has:
  A name (e.g., username, password)
  A data type (e.g., string)
  Optional formats or rules
  -Field Data: Data stored in a field. Data can be:
- Unencrypted: stored as plaintext, same value on all nodes
- Encrypted: split into shares by nilQL; each node stores a separate share

### Getting Started / Quickstart

The following and CRUCIAL structure to create a SecretVault app in either Python or JS, is to:

1. Register an organization
2. Define a collection via the Schema Tools
3. Storing the records
4. Retrieve the records
5. Define a query
6. Execute a query.

If you want to encrypt your data, it is ESSENTIAL to use the library nilQL - which is outlined in the libraries section.

1. Register an Organization
   Access the SecretVault Registration Portal via https://sv-sda-registration.replit.app/
   Register your organization by providing a name
   Select your preferred nilDB nodes - this defaults to the cluster config of demo nodes

Public Demo Node Cluster Configuration
The following nodes are available in the public demo cluster configuration. Each node provides its connection details and a Swagger UI (API docs) where you can explore and test the node's API endpoints.

2. Define a Collection
   To store data in SecretVault, you'll need to define a Collection with a JSON Schema, which creates a structured container for your records (individual pieces of data). This has two main effects:

Creates a Collection in SecretVault for your data
Links the Collection to your Organization and validates all records before storage, ensuring they adhere to the JSON Schema
You can create schema collections using the SecretVault Tools UI or programmatically:

We recommend the Schema Tools for ease of use via https://schema-tools.vercel.app/

You can:

- Use a Schema template
- Create your own
- Upload an existing one

Then validate + upload it. Then see the `collection` in the Collection Tab page.

Alternatively, here is the programatic approach:

a. Plan Your Collection's Data Structure
Sketch out your data structure to plan the fields and types that will define your collection's JSON schema. Here's an example:

Example Data

```
  years_in_web3 = 3 //integer, encrypted
  responses = [] //array
    question_number = 1 //integer
    rating = 5 //integer
```

b. Create the JSON Schema
Convert your data structure into a JSON Schema following these requirements:
Use JSON Schema draft-07, type "array"
Each record needs a unique \_id (UUID format, coerce: true)
Use "date-time" format for dates (coerce: true)
Remember to take into account the type for fields that you want to encrypt using %allot/%share
Mark required fields (\_id is always required)
Set additionalProperties to false
Avoid "$" prefix in field names to prevent query conflicts
Note: System adds \_created and \_updated fields automatically
Use a JSON Schema validator tool (https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/) to make sure your collection's schema is valid.

Example:

```
examples/store/schema.json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Web3 Experience Survey",
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "_id": {
        "type": "string",
        "format": "uuid",
        "coerce": true
      },
      "years_in_web3": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "%share": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "required": ["%share"]
      },
      "responses": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "rating": {
              "type": "integer",
              "minimum": 1,
              "maximum": 5
            },
            "question_number": {
              "type": "integer",
              "minimum": 1
            }
          },
          "required": ["rating", "question_number"]
        },
        "minItems": 1
      }
    },
    "required": ["_id", "years_in_web3", "responses"]
  }
}

```

c. Use the Create Schema API to Create your Schema and Collection
Decide on a collection name and generate a UUID4 for the Collection ID (use identical UUID across all Cluster nodes).

Select which fields should act as primary keys / unique identifiers (\_id should always be included).

Then use the Create Schema endpoint to upload your JSON schema to each node in your organization using valid API tokens for each node.

Example POST Schema:

```
  {
    "_id": "9b22147f-d6d5-40f1-927d-96c08XXXXXXXX",
    "name": "Web3 Experience Survey",
    "keys": ["_id"],
    "schema": {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
      "title": "Web3 Experience Survey",
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "_id": {
            "type": "string",
            "format": "uuid",
            "coerce": true
          },
          "years_in_web3": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "%share": {
                "type": "string"
              }
            },
            "required": ["%share"]
          },
          "responses": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "rating": {
                  "type": "integer",
                  "minimum": 1,
                  "maximum": 5
                },
                "question_number": {
                  "type": "integer",
                  "minimum": 1
                }
              },
              "required": ["rating", "question_number"]
            },
            "minItems": 1
          }
        },
        "required": ["_id", "years_in_web3", "responses"]
      }
    }
  }
```

3. Store Records
   First, encrypt any private data fields with nilQL.

a. Check Your Collection for the Schema ID
List available Collections using the List Schemas endpoint (GET /schemas) to get the Schema ID of the collection you want to store your data in.

b. Store a Record
Before storing:

- Encrypt any private fields using nilQL to get encrypted shares
- Make sure data matches your Collection's JSON Schema
- Generate and include a unique \_id (UUIDv4) for each record

Example POST `data/create` schema

```
{
  "schema": "9b22147f-d6d5-40f1-927d-96c08XXXXXXXX",
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "120a60f3-d1b6-4a11-a413-abcd60c8ccb3",
      "years_in_web3": "zKH1L", // encrypted share
      "responses": [
        { "rating": 5, "question_number": 1 },
        { "rating": 3, "question_number": 2 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "_id": "b321301b-ffcd-43d8-bec7-4b0830f7a305",
      "years_in_web3": "5J_KL4", // encrypted share
      "responses": [
        { "rating": 2, "question_number": 1 },
        { "rating": 4, "question_number": 2 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

Upload to all nodes using each node's Upload/Create Data endpoint using valid API tokens to authenticate requests to each node. The response includes:

Created records
Any validation errors, where any issues with data ingestion will be described even if the communication with the node resulted in a 200 status response. You can check out an example below that showcases both instances:

Example POST /data/create Response

```
{
   "data": {
      "created": [
         "120a60f3-d1b6-4a11-a413-abcd60c8ccb3"
      ],
      "errors": [
         {
            "error": "E11000 duplicate key error collection: datablocks_data.f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2XXXXXX index: _id_ dup key: { _id: UUID(\"b321301b-ffcd-43d8-bec7-4b0830f7a305\") }",
            "document": {
              "_id": "b321301b-ffcd-43d8-bec7-4b0830f7a305",
              "years_in_web3": "5J_KL4",
              "responses": [
                { "rating": 2, "question_number": 1 },
                { "rating": 4, "question_number": 2 }
              ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

4. Retrieve Records
   Read or retrieve a record by fetching the data from all nodes in your cluster. Decrypt private data fields with nilQL to recombine shares from all nodes and reconstruct the original data.

a. Check Your Collection for the Schema ID
List available Collections using the List Schemas endpoint (GET /schemas) to get the Schema ID of the collection you want to store your data in.

b. Retrieve Records
Retrieve records from a collection by calling the Read Data endpoint (POST /data/read) with the schema id and optionally a filter. If you don't pass in a filter, all records will be returned.

Using a filter
A filter can be a basic match. (e.g. `"status": "active")`, a comparison (e.g. `"age" : { "$gte": 30}`) or something more complex.

Complex Filtering example:

```
{
  "filter": {
    "$and": [
        { "status": "active" },
        { "age": { "$gte": 30 } },
        { "tags": { "$in": ["premium", "verified"] } }
    ]
  }
}
```

Example for retrieving records

```
{
   "schema": "9b22147f-d6d5-40f1-927d-96c08XXXXXXXX",
   "filter": {
      "_id": "120a60f3-d1b6-4a11-a413-abcd60c8ccb3"
   }
}
```

Other operations on records available at: https://docs.nillion.com/api/nildb/overview

- Update Data endpoint (also supported via the secretvault JS+Python wrappers)
- Delete Data endpoint (also supported via the secretvault JS+Python wrappers)
- Flush Data endpoint
- Tail Data endpoint

5. Define a Query | Data Analytics
   To run Data Analytics on SecretVault, you'll need to define a query. This is an enhanced MongoDB aggregation pipeline that is executed on the data stored on SecretVault. The support for variables in these queries/aggregations is the highlighted additional feature.

a. Before we begin, we need to take into consideration the type of operation our data were encrypted for. While the query/aggregation can perform any kind of computation on data stored as plaintext, for encrypted data there are only two options:

Data stored with the STORE option can only be retrieved as is
Data stored with the SUM option can have summation run directly on the encrypted shares - the results of this from all the nodes can then be reconstructed
Queries are formulated using MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines.

Additionally, there's an option for using variables (variables can be of type string, number, boolean, date, and array of the former 4 - they are referenced in the aggregation using a ## prefix).

For the examples below we'll use the "Web3 survey" schema and showcase two different queries for STORE and SUM operations.

Example for `store` schema

```
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Web3 Experience Survey",
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "_id": {
        "type": "string",
        "format": "uuid",
        "coerce": true
      },
      "years_in_web3": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "%share": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "required": ["%share"]
      },
      "responses": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "object",

        ]
    }
```

b. Use the Create Query API to register your query

Decide on a query name/description and generate a UUID4 for the Collection ID (use identical UUID across all Cluster nodes). You'll also need the schema id of the collection you're going to run the query against. You can get this via GET /schemas - check out the List Schemas endpoint) page for details.

Then use the Create Query endpoint to upload your query to each node in your organization using valid API tokens for each node.

Example of `POST / queries` payload

```
{
   "_id": "21b9911a-37c1-4626-8863-e465eXXXXXXX",
   "name": "Returns sum of years_in_web3 and count of users that have answered question X",
   "schema": "9b22147f-d6d5-40f1-927d-96c08XXXXXXXX",
   "variables": {
   "question_number": {
      "type": "number",
      "description": "The target question"
    }
  },
  "pipeline":
      [
        {
          "$match": {
            "responses.question_number": "##question_number"
          }
        },
        {
          "$group": {
            "_id": null,
            "total_years": { "$sum": "$years_in_web3.%share" },
            "count": { "$sum": 1 }
          }
        },
        {
          "$project": {
            "_id": 0,
            "sum_years_in_web3": {
              "%share": {
                "$mod": [
                  "$total_years",
                  { "$add": [{ "$pow": [2, 32] }, 15] }
                ]
              }
            },
            "user_count": "$count"
          }
        }
      ]
}
```

6. Execute a Query | Data Analytics
   Running your queries is pretty straightforward, you only need the query id and any optional variables required.

   a. Check Your Queries for the Query ID
   List available Queries using the List Queries endpoint (GET /queries) to get the Query ID.

   b. Executing the Query
   Using the query id and any variables required you are ready to setup the payload for executing the query via the Execute Query endpoint:

   Example POST /queries/execute Payload

   ```
   {
   "id": "dfcee886-231d-4a9d-9bdd-857f74XXXXX",
   "variables": {
    "question_number": 5
   }
   }
   ```

Opionated: Nextjs + Javascript + app router app
If you are looking to create a nextjs + javascript / typescript with app router config, use this example:

1. Create a nextjs app via `npx create-next-app` + `npm install secretvaults`. `secretvaults` is a wrapper over `nilQl`
2. Use this one-shot prompt to assist with your example app

## Let's build a NextJS guestbook style app with typescript + tailwind CSS where people can sign the book saying their name and a memo

We want to also create a backend or api in the app that connects to Nillion SecretVault.

Here's an example of what writing data and reading data looks like.

The app should use this style of code to post to SecretVault and read from SecretVault.

```
import { SecretVaultWrapper } from 'secretvaults';

const orgConfig = {
  orgCredentials: {
    secretKey: '0ac97ffdd83769c6c5032cb202d0957800e0ef151f015b0aaec52e2d864d4fc6',

## SecretLLM

SecretLLM is a set of OpenAI-compatible APIs that run AI models within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). You can use SecretLLM to build new private AI applications or migrate existing ones to run in a secure SecretLLM environment where your data remains private.

### Available models

- meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct: 3 Billion Parameter Model for quick responses, simple Q&A, basic chat. Faster inference with lower resource usage.
- meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct: 8 Billion Parameter Model for more complex tasks, detailed responses, code generation. Higher quality but slower inference.

### Key Features

- Drop-in Privacy: Keep your OpenAI-style code, just point it to SecretLLM
- Privacy Through TEEs: All processing happens within a TEE, built on NVIDIA Confidential Computing
- Standard Security: HTTPS encryption provides end-to-end protection for all data in transit between your application and the TEE environment
- Cryptographic Attestation: Verify the integrity of your TEE environment through our attestation API
- Signed Responses: Every model response includes a cryptographic signature for verification

### Attestation & Verification

SecretLLM provides two layers of cryptographic proof:

1. Environment Attestation: Verify your TEE's integrity through the attestation endpoint, including GPU environment verification and Service verification through a verifying key
2. Response Signatures: Every chat completion response includes a cryptographic signature, allowing you to verify that the response came from the attested environment.

### Getting Started / Quickstart

0. Use `Nillion2025` as the dev testing API key. Use the nilAI Registration Page for an API Key: https://nillion.pub/nilai-registration-page/ for production Keys.
1. Send your prompt to SecretLLM over HTTPS (just like any secure web request)
2. Your prompt runs inside a Trusted Execution Environment where it is hidden from the cloud provider
3. Get your result back over HTTPS, complete with a cryptographic signature

Examples:

```javascript (node)
const OpenAI = require('openai');
require('dotenv').config();

// Initialize the OpenAI client
// baseURL is the nilAI node url: https://docs.nillion.com/network#nilai-nodes
// apiKey is your nilAI node api key: https://docs.nillion.com/build/secretLLM/access
const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://nilai-a779.nillion.network/v1',
  apiKey: process.env.NILAI_API_KEY || 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
});

async function generateText() {
  try {
    const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'system',
          content: 'You are a fitness coach.',
        },
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: 'What is better for you, salad or pizza?',
        },
      ],
      stream: false,
    });

    // Every SecretLLM response includes a cryptographic signature for verification
    console.log(`Signature: ${response.signature}`);
    console.log(`Response: ${response.choices[0].message.content}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

generateText();
```

```python

from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the OpenAI client

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://nilai-<node>.nillion.network/v1/",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
)

# Send a chat completion request

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is your name?"
        }
    ],
    stream=False
)

```

```javascript
// nextjs app / api router
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  try {
    const body = await req.json();

    const response = await fetch(
      `${process.env.NILAI_API_URL}/v1/chat/completions`,
      {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.NILAI_API_KEY}`,
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          model: 'meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct',
          messages: body.messages,
          temperature: 0.2,
        }),
      }
    );

    const data = await response.json();
    return NextResponse.json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Chat error:', error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Failed to process chat request' },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

}'
```

## Libraries

### nilQL

nilQL (Nillion Query Library) is a cryptographic library for secure data operations. While nilQL can be used as a general-purpose encryption/decryption library, Nillion leverages nilQL specifically for encrypting data stored in SecretVault and enabling secure operations within nilDB queries and replies.

Usage:

- Standalone Library: Developers can use nilQL as a general-purpose encryption/decryption library for their applications.
- With SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics:
  You can interact with SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics either directly through nilQL or using the optional secretvaults package (available in JS and Python):

  Use nilQL to encrypt record field values with your organization's private key before storage in a SecretVault collection
  Store the encrypted shares of record field values across your organization's nilDB nodes
  Query nilQL encrypted data that has been stored in SecretVault to perform secure operations on nilQL encrypted data via SecretDataAnalytics APIs

Implementations:

- nilql-ts: TypeScript library for web and Node.js environments
- nilql-py: Python library for server-side applications
- secretvaults (JS): an NPM package wrapper providing simplified integration with nilQL & SecretVault
- secretvaults (Python): an PyPi package wrapper providing simplified integration with nilQL & SecretVault

Supported Operations

- **Store Single**: XSalsa20 stream cipher with Poly1305 MAC, supports 32-bit signed integer, UTF-8 string (max 4096 bytes)
- **Match Single**: Deterministic salted hashing via SHA-512, supports 32-bit signed integer, UTF-8 string (max 4096 bytes)
- **Sum Single**: Non-deterministic Paillier with 2048-bit primes, supports 32-bit signed integer
- **Store Multiple**: XOR-based secret sharing, supports 32-bit signed integer, UTF-8 string (max 4096 bytes)
- **Match Multiple**: Deterministic salted hashing via SHA-512, supports 32-bit signed integer, UTF-8 string (max 4096 bytes)
- **Sum Multiple**: Additive secret sharing with modulus 2^32, supports 32-bit signed integer

- https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nilql-py for Python

### Encypt and decrypt data

Use nilQL to encrypt and decrypt data.

To apply encryption to your data, they are to be secret shared across your selected nodes.
This is to be done with nilQL, a library for working with encrypted data within nilDB queries and replies, available in Python and TypeScript.
You can find an example on using nilQL to encrypt/decrypt data below.

Approaches: Python and Javascript

Python

- Install nilQL using your preferred package manager: `pip install nilql`

Python (Standalone)

```
"""Encryption utilities using nilql for secret sharing."""
import nilql
from typing import List

class DataEncryption:
    def __init__(self, num_nodes: int):
        self.num_nodes = num_nodes
        self.secret_key = nilql.ClusterKey.generate({'nodes': [{}] * num_nodes},{'store': True})

    def encrypt_password(self, password: str) -> List[str]:
        """Encrypt password using secret sharing."""
        try:
            encrypted_shares = nilql.encrypt(self.secret_key, password)

            return list(encrypted_shares)
        except Exception as e:
            raise Exception(f"Encryption failed: {str(e)}")

    def decrypt_password(self, encoded_shares: List[str]) -> str:
        """Decrypt password from shares."""
        try:
            decoded_shares = []
            for share in encoded_shares:
                decoded_shares.append(share)

            return str(nilql.decrypt(self.secret_key, decoded_shares))
        except Exception as e:
            raise Exception(f"Decryption failed: {str(e)}")
```

Javascript / TypeScript
Install nilql-ts, the TypeScript library for web and Node.js environments: `pnpm install @nillion/nilql`

Standalone usage (TypeScript)

```
// src/lib/encryption.ts
import { nilql } from '@nillion/nilql';

export interface EncryptionConfig {
  nodes: number;
  operations?: {
    store?: boolean;

Usage with SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics
To encrypt data for use within SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics, you can create a cluster key by passing in

your cluster config of node urls and node DIDs
your selected operation (store, match, sum)

```

const cluster = {
nodes: [
{
url: 'https://nildb-zy8u.nillion.network',
did: 'did:nil:testnet:nillion1fnhettvcrsfu8zkd5zms4d820l0ct226c3zy8u',
},
{
url: 'https://nildb-rl5g.nillion.network',
did: 'did:nil:testnet:nillion14x47xx85de0rg9dqunsdxg8jh82nvkax3jrl5g',
},
{
url: 'https://nildb-lpjp.nillion.network',
did: 'did:nil:testnet:nillion167pglv9k7m4gj05rwj520a46tulkff332vlpjp',
}
]
}

const operation = {
store: true
}

```

nilQl/wrapper.js

```


async init() {
// Create secretKey from secretKeySeed, if provided
if (this.secretKeySeed && this.secretKey === null) {

```
