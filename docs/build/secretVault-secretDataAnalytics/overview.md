# Overview

Securely store your data with **SecretVault** + run secure queries and computations on them with **SecretDataAnalytics**.

- **SecretVault**: Use Nillion's encryption libraries to secret share your data across our decentralised network of nodes to store and retrieve it using Nillion's easy to use RESTful API
- **SecretDataAnalytics**: Run encrypted queries across your data stored in the SecretVault using our easy to use RESTful API, with Nillion's decryption libraries to reconstruct the result.

# Try them out in a demo environment

Before diving down in the full details and guides on how to access and then build using SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics, why not get a taste of them in action first?

- You can try out **SecretVault** in our demo node under a publicly shared organization. Upload some data [here](../../api/nildb/upload-data-to-the-specified-schema-collection) :arrow_upper_right:.
- Then use **SecretDataAnalytics** in the same fashion [here](../../api/nildb/execute-the-specified-query) :bar_chart: to retrieve some insights from the common SecretVault collection where you and other users have uploaded your test data.
