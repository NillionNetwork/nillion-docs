# Getting Started

Let's get started with SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics in a few steps!

To make it easier for you, we have a publicly available shared organization with a pre-defined schema and queries that anyone can use to securely store and then query some test data. This is accessible here with an OpenAPI Swagger interface for `/data/create` and `/data/read`.

`queries/execute` is for more advanced cross-schema queries.
