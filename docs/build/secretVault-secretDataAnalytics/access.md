# Register an Organization

[temp] This is for the public/demo/test node cluster. If you're interested for more, please fill in this [form](https://forms.gle/Um3xLwMKyKPyAP9i6).

### Create an Organization

Use the [SecretVault Organization Portal](https://secret-vault-registration.replit.app/) to get started by registering an organization, your root entity in SecretVault. Choose a name for your org and select the nilDB nodes you'd like your org to use.

### Store your Organization's credentials

After creating an organization, you will see a page that has

- your org's credentials including an org DID and org public/private key pair
- your org's cluster config for selected nodes

Make sure to copy the credentials and cluster to config to a secure place. **You are solely responsible for keeping your credentials safe and available.** We will not be able to retrieve/regenerate organization credentials for you, and you will not be able to access data within SecretVault without these credentials.
