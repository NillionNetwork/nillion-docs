# Network API Access

nilPay allows you to subscribe and create credentials for using the [Private Storage](/build/secret-vault/about) and [Private LLMs](/build/secretLLM/overview) network APIs.

This guide walks you through the process of creating an API key.

:::info
The **Old Flow** will be deprecated by August 1, 2025. Please use the **NUCS** flow to create API keys.

    ## Create an API Key

    In order to get an API Key, you must have a nillion address. We recommend starting by following the [wallet setup guide](/guide-nillion-wallet) to get started.

    Use the [nilPay Portal](https://nilpay.vercel.app/) to create an API key. Press the **Need an API Key?** button.

    ![nilPay Page](/img/nilpay_page.png)

    Ensure you keep your API key safe and do not share it with anyone.

    ![nilPay API Key](/img/nilpay_api_key.png)

    Enter your public key to associate your API key with your nillion address.

    ## Subscription to nilAI and/or nilDB

    In order to subscribe to a nillion service, you must have a subscription. This is possible by using a set amount of uNIL tokens.

    This is currently for testnet, therefore you can get free NIL from the [testnet faucet.](https://faucet.testnet.nillion.com/) We also have a testnet faucet [guide](/guide-testnet-faucet) to help you get started.

    Click on the either the **Subscribe to nilAI** or **Subscribe to nilDB** button to subscribe and follow the wallet prompts.

    After the payment goes through, you will have a 28 day subscription to the service and can now use your keys.

    This is possible for both services by following the same steps.

    ## Create an API Key

    Use the [SecretLLM Registration Portal](https://nillion.pub/nilai-registration-page/) to create and verify your API key.

    ![SecretLLM Access Home](/img/nilai_access_home.png)

    There are two options to create an API Key via:

    1. Keplr
    2. MetaMask

    Choose either of the flows. Authenticate and prove the ownership of the account.

    ![SecretLLM Access MetaMask](/img/nilai_access_metamask.png)

    You will then receive an API key which requires verification.

    ![SecretLLM Access API Key](/img/nilai_access_apikey.png)

    You are now able to get started with using your own SecretLLM API Key to build private AI inferred applications.

      # Register an Organization

:::info
When using the [SecretVault Registration Portal](https://sv-sda-registration.replit.app/) to create your org, it will use the public demo node cluster. You'll be using the public demo node cluster by default. For production usage, please complete our [access form](https://forms.gle/Um3xLwMKyKPyAP9i6) to request allowlist access to the testnet node cluster.
:::

### Create an Organization

Use the [SecretVault Registration Portal](https://sv-sda-registration.replit.app/) to get started by registering an organization, your root entity in SecretVault.

1. Access the SecretVault Registration Portal
2. Register your organization by providing a name
3. Select your preferred nilDB nodes - this defaults to the cluster config of demo nodes

![SecretVault Registration Portal](/img/sv-org-portal.png)

### Store your Organization's credentials

After registration, you'll receive:

- Organization credentials (your organization's DID and public/private key pair)
- Cluster configuration for your selected nodes

**Important: Copy these credentials and store them securely. Your organization credentials cannot be retrieved or regenerated, and you won't be able to access your SecretVault data without them.** If you select "Returning Organization" from the portal, you will only be able to see the cluster configuration details for your organization by DID.

The following nodes are available in the public demo cluster configuration. Each node provides its connection details and a Swagger UI (API docs) where you can explore and test the node's API endpoints.
