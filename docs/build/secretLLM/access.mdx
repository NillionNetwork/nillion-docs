# API Key

SecretLLM provides secure access to the nilAI node API through API key authentication. This guide walks you through the process of creating a nilAI API key.

:::info
The old flow will be deprecated by the 1st of August 2025. Please use the NUCS flow to create your API key.

    ## Create an API Key

    In order to get an API Key, you must have a nillion address. We recommend starting by following the [wallet setup guide](/guide-nillion-wallet) to get started.

    Use the [nilPay Portal](https://nilpay.vercel.app/) to create an API key. Press the `Need an API Key?` button.

    Ensure you keep your API key safe and do not share it with anyone.

    Enter your public key to associate your API key with your nillion address.

    ## Subscription to nilAI

    In order to subscribe to SecretLLM / nilAI, you must have a subscription. This is possible by using a set amount of uNIL tokens.

    This is currently for testnet, therefore you can get free NIL from the [testnet faucet.](https://faucet.testnet.nillion.com/) We also have a testnet faucet [guide](/guide-testnet-faucet) to help you get started.

    Click on the `Subscribe to nilAI` button to subscribe and follow the wallet prompts.

    After the payment goes through, you will have a 28 day subscription to the service and can now use your keys.

    This is also possible for nilDB service by following the same steps.

    ## Create an API Key

    Use the [SecretLLM Registration Portal](https://nillion.pub/nilai-registration-page/) to create and verify your API key.

    ![SecretLLM Access Home](/img/nilai_access_home.png)

    There are two options to create an API Key via:

    1. Keplr
    2. MetaMask

    Choose either of the flows. Authenticate and prove the ownership of the account.

    ![SecretLLM Access MetaMask](/img/nilai_access_metamask.png)

    You will then receive an API key which requires verification.

    You are now able to get started with using your own SecretLLM API Key to build private AI inferred applications.
