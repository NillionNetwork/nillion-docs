You can try SecretLLM with demo credentials or create your own API key.

## Demo credentials

You can test the SecretLLM APIs with our demo credentials:

```bash
NILAI_API_URL=https://nilai-a779.nillion.network
NILAI_API_KEY=Nillion2025
```

:::info
Note: These demo credentials should only be used for testing endpoints or trying out the SecretLLM Quickstart. If you're building an application, please use the below to create your own API Key.

## Create an API Key

If you're building a private AI app and need your own API key, use the [SecretLLM Registration Portal](https://nillion.pub/nilai-registration-page/) to create and verify your API key.

There are two options to create an API Key via:

1. Keplr
2. MetaMask

Choose either of the flows. Authenticate and prove the ownership of the account.

You will then receive an API key which requires verification.

You are now able to get started with using your own SecretLLM API Key to build private AI inferred applications.
