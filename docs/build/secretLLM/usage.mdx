# Usage

Once you have a [nilAI API key](build/secretLLM/access.md), you can start using SecretLLM with any OpenAI-compatible library.

## Getting Started with SecretLLM

Getting started with SecretLLM is straightforward:

1. Select a [nilAI node url](/network#nilai-nodes)
2. Query the [`/v1/models`](/api/nilai/get-models-v-1-models-get) endpoint or check [available models](/build/secretLLM/overview#available-models)
3. Select an available model and use it with the [`/v1/chat/completions`](/api/nilai/chat-completion-v-1-chat-completions-post) nilAI node endpoint

Since SecretLLM is OpenAI-compatible, you can use any OpenAI library. Here's an example for querying the `Llama-3.1-8B` model:

Response: As a fitness coach, I'd say it's not necessarily about which one is better, but rather about balance and moderation. Both salads and pizza can be part of a healthy diet, but it depends on how they're prepared and consumed.

A salad, when made with nutrient-dense ingredients like leafy greens, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats, can be an excellent choice for a healthy meal. It's high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and can help support weight loss, improve digestion, and boost energy levels.

On the other hand, pizza, when made with refined flour, processed meats, and high amounts of cheese, can be a less-than-ideal choice. It's high in calories, saturated fat, sodium, and refined carbohydrates, which can lead to weight gain, inflammation, and other health problems.

However, if you're craving pizza, there are ways to make it healthier. Look for options that use:

1. Whole-wheat or cauliflower crust
2. Lean protein sources like chicken, turkey, or plant-based options
3. Fresh vegetables like bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms
4. Low-fat cheese or dairy-free alternatives
5. Herbs and spices for flavor instead of salt and sugar

In contrast, a salad can be made healthier by:

1. Using a variety of colorful vegetables
2. Adding lean protein sources like grilled chicken, salmon, or tofu
3. Incorporating healthy fats like avocado, nuts, or seeds
4. Using a homemade vinaigrette dressing instead of store-bought
5. Limiting or avoiding added sugars and refined grains

Ultimately, the better choice between salad and pizza depends on your individual needs and preferences. If you're looking for a quick, easy, and nutritious meal, a salad might be the way to go. But if you're craving something more indulgent, a healthier pizza option can be a better choice.

As a fitness coach, I always recommend balance and variety in your diet. Aim to include a mix of whole, unprocessed foods, and indulge in moderation. Listen to your body and make choices that nourish your mind, body, and soul.
