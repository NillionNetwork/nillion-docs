# Secretvaults SDK

secretvaults is an SDK that simplifies interacting with nilDB nodes to store and retrieve data encrypted with [blindfold](/build/private-storage/blindfold). Two versions of the SDK are available:

- TypeScript library for web and Node.js environments: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/secretvaults-ts) and [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nillion/secretvaults)
  - [TypeDoc](https://nillion.pub/secretvaults-ts/) and [TypeScript Examples](https://nillion.pub/secretvaults-ts/classes/SecretVaultBuilderClient.html)
- Python library for server-side applications: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/secretvaults-py) and [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/secretvaults)
  - [Python Examples](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/secretvaults-py/tree/main/examples)

## No-Code Alternative: Collection Explorer

If you prefer a visual interface, check out the [Collection Explorer](/build/private-storage/collection-explorer). This no-code web tool provides the same functionality as the Secretvaults SDK through an intuitive UI, allowing you to:

- Create and manage schemas, collections, and records without coding
- Build production-ready collections through a visual interface
- Export schemas for use in programmatic applications
- Enable non-technical team members to work directly with Nillion Private Storage

Collections and schemas created through the Collection Explorer are fully compatible with the Secretvaults SDK, giving you the flexibility to use whichever approach fits your workflow best.
