# About

### What is Nillion

Nillion is a secure computation network that decentralizes trust for high-value, sensitive, and private data in the same way that blockchains decentralize transactions.

### Intro to Nillion

Nillion is a decentralized data storage and computation network and an accompanying a suite of tools that together allow builders to build novel, powerful applications that leverage high-value data in a safer way. Its modular and flexible architecture makes it possible to leverage cutting-edge cryptographic techniques to accomplish this, enabling both more secure versions of existing workflows and unlocking new opportunities. Early builders in the Nillion community are creating tooling for private predictive AI, secure storage and compute solutions for healthcare, storage solutions for secure data such as credentials, and secure workflows for trade data.

### What is Blind Computation

When sensitive data is encrypted and stored, the traditional approaches to doing useful work with that data involve decrypting it in order to perform any necessary computations (and then potentially re-encrypting the results). This decrypt-compute-re-encrypt cycle not only exposes the data to the operators of the computing infrastructure. Blind computation makes it possible to perform useful work on data while it remains encrypted, even if the operator of the computing infrastructure does not possess the ability to decrypt it.

### What are Blind Modules

Nillion makes blind computation possible by leveraging a number of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as secure multi-party computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE). Each blind module packages and combines one or more PETs in a developer-friendly way, bringing these capabilities to a broader audience.
Modules

- nilDB

nilDB is Nillion's secure database solution, enabling data to be stored in an encrypted (via symmetric cryptography or HE) and/or decentralized (via MPC) way. Data is stored on a cluster of network nodes (with the current cluster consisting of three nodes).
nilDB is the Blind Module that underpins Nillion's SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics products. SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics data are accessed via an easy-to-use RESTful API with endpoints to create/upload, retrieve, and query data. Developers can use our nilQL library to encrypt and/or secret share data on the client side before using our RESTful API to send the ciphertexts and/or secret shares to the nodes.

- nilAI

nilAI is Nillion's secure AI offering, which runs LLMs securely inside TEEs. nilAI is the Blind Module that underpins SecretLLM.
Like SecretVault and SecretDataAnalytics, this SDK can be accessed via an easy-to-use RESTful API that allows users to run inference using supported models.

- nilVM

The core functionality provided by nilVM is the ability to sign data in a decentralized way using MPC, which can be leveraged using SecretSigner.
nilVM can also be leveraged using our Python or TypeScript clients and includes the Nada programming language.
