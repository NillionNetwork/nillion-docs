# Network API Access

nilPay allows you to subscribe and create credentials for using the [Private Storage](/build/private-storage/overview) and [Private LLMs](/build/private-llms/overview) network APIs.

This guide walks you through the process of creating an API key.

## Create an API Key

In order to get an API Key, you must have a nillion address. We recommend starting by following the [wallet setup guide](/community/guides/nillion-wallet) to get started.

Use the [nilPay Portal](https://subscription.nillion.com) to create an API key. Press the **Need an API Key?** button.

Ensure you keep your API key safe and do not share it with anyone.

Enter your public key to associate your API key with your nillion address.

## Subscription to nilAI and/or nilDB

In order to subscribe to a nillion service, you must have a subscription. This is possible by using a set amount of uNIL tokens.

This is currently for testnet, therefore you can get free NIL from the [testnet faucet.](https://faucet.testnet.nillion.com/) We also have a testnet faucet [guide](/community/guides/testnet-faucet) to help you get started.

Click on the either the **Subscribe to nilAI** or **Subscribe to nilDB** button to subscribe and follow the wallet prompts.

After the payment goes through, you will have a 28 day subscription to the service and can now use your keys.

This is possible for both services by following the same steps.
