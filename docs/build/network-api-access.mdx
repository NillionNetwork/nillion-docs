# Network API Access

nilPay allows you to subscribe and create credentials for using the [Private Storage](/build/private-storage/overview) and [Private LLMs](/build/private-llms/overview) network APIs.

This guide walks you through the process of creating an API key.

## Create an API Key

In order to get an API Key, you must have a nillion address. We recommend starting by following the [wallet setup guide](/community/guides/nillion-wallet) to get started.

Use the [nilPay Subscription Portal](https://subscription.nillion.com) to create an API key. 

Ensure you have an EVM browser wallet (i.e. Metamask) + a Cosmos based walled (i.e. Keplr)

![nilPay Payment Types](/img/nilpay-payment-types.png)

For nilDB, you can use all of these options to pay for the subscription.
- If you want an Ethereum wallet to be the authority for your keys you can use the `Brower Wallet` option.
- Otherwise if you prefer to be key based, you may import one of your older keys via `Use Secret Key` or `Generate New Key` to create a new one.

If using the Browser Wallet option, you have two options:
1. Pay for yourself which is recommended if you are the developer of the application.
2. Paying for others which is recommended if you are subscribing on behalf of someone else .

For nilAI, you can either use the `Use Secret Key` or `Generate New Key` option for now.

Also ensure to mark the `Create legacy did:nil (for backwards compatibility). This must be selected for nilAI` checkbox for backwards compatibility.

## Subscription to nilAI and/or nilDB

In order to subscribe to a nillion service, you must have a subscription. This is possible by using a set amount of uNIL tokens.

This is currently for testnet, therefore you can get free NIL from the [testnet faucet.](https://faucet.testnet.nillion.com/) We also have a testnet faucet [guide](/community/guides/testnet-faucet) to help you get started.

Click on the either the **Subscribe to nilAI** or **Subscribe to nilDB** button to subscribe and follow the wallet prompts.

After the payment goes through, you will have a 28 day subscription to the service and can now use your keys.

This is possible for both services by following the same steps.
