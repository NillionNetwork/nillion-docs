# AI-Assisted Workflow

To help AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) provide better support for Nillion development, we provide structured information about our platform, APIs, and development patterns.

## Nillion Builder Guide LLM

The [Nillion Builder Guide LLM](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-687e6e6b52508191bb1537b422aad489-nillion-builder-guide) is a specialized ChatGPT assistant trained on the Nillion docs and development patterns. Chat with it directly to learn about Nillion and start building privacy-preserving apps using Nillion solutions.

## llm.txt

Our `llm.txt` file contains comprehensive information about Nillion's architecture, developer tools, and integration guides. AI assistants can use this to understand:

- Core concepts like Blind Computation and Blind Modules
- Developer flow from wallet creation to app deployment
- Private Storage and Private LLMs solutions
- SDKs, tools, and code examples
- Links to detailed documentation and tutorials

**Access the llm.txt:** [https://docs.nillion.com/llm.txt](https://docs.nillion.com/llm.txt)

### How to Use

When working with AI assistants on Nillion projects:

1. **Reference the llm.txt**: Point your AI assistant to `https://docs.nillion.com/llm.txt` for comprehensive context
2. **Ask specific questions**: The more specific your questions, the better assistance you'll receive
3. **Mention your platform**: Specify if you're using Node.js, Next.js, React, or Python for targeted guidance
4. **Include your use case**: Whether building Private Storage or Private LLMs applications

### Example Prompts

**Note:** These prompts assume you already have a Nillion API Key. If you don't have one yet, follow the [nilPay Guide](/build/network-api-access) to subscribe to services.
