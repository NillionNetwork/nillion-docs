This page describes the initial Nillion task for Hacker House Goa for MacOS and Linux users. If you are on Windows, head over to [this page](https://docs.nillion.com/hacker-house-goa-windows). 

The initial task should take 30-45 minutes and will help you get started with Nillion; join our social channels, and start working with our SDK. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them on the discord channel.

The 50 best tasks that are submitted will be awarded a $20 prize 🎉 Good luck!

Follow the steps below to complete the task:

1. Join our community:
    - [Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/nillionnetwork)
      - Make sure you join the `developers-sdk` channel
      - Once you fill out the form at the end of this task, we will add you to a dedicated `hacker-house-goa` Discord channel too.

2. Star & fork the [Python](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nillion-python-starter) quickstart repo & the [JavaScript Quickstart repo](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/cra-nillion/).
    
    🚨 Add the topic `nillion-nada` to this repo so we can find it easily 
    
3. Follow at least one of the quickstarts (Python or JavaScript) in the [Developer Quickstart](/quickstart)
    
    🚨 Make sure you [enable telemetry](/nillion-sdk-and-tools#installation) as you install the Nillion SDK. Start your telemetry identifier with `hacker-house-goa` so we can identify you
    
4. Once you have completed the quickstart, add at least one new [nada program](/nada-lang-programs) to your repo (bonus points for creativity, but make sure it compiles and runs)
    - Python quickstart: add your nada program in your repo's programs folder.
    - JavaScript quickstart: add your program in your repo's [public/programs](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/cra-nillion/tree/main/public/programs) folder
    - The Nillion team will review all your new nada programs and award $20 prizes to the best 50.
