# Limitations

## Overview

The Nillion SDK is currently in active development, providing developers with essential tools to build on the Nillion Network. This document outlines the current limitations and constraints you should be aware of when developing with our SDK.

Our current release includes:
- Python, JavaScript, and CLI clients
- Nada programming language
- Command line development tools

## Development Status and Expectations

- **Active Development**: The SDK is evolving rapidly with frequent updates
- **Breaking Changes**: May occur but will be communicated via [Announcements](https://github.com/orgs/NillionNetwork/discussions)
- **Community Feedback**:
  - Report bugs in [Bugs](https://github.com/orgs/NillionNetwork/discussions/categories/bugs)
  - Suggest features in [Ideas](https://github.com/orgs/NillionNetwork/discussions/categories/ideas)
  - Report documentation issues via [Github Issues](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nillion-docs/issues/new/choose)

Here are some of the limitations or constraints you should be aware of when being an early builder with Nillionâ€™s SDK.

## Platforms

The [Nillion SDK tool](/nillion-sdk-and-tools) binaries can be installed with [`nilup`](/nilup) for the following platforms:

- Apple (M1/M2)
- Apple (Intel chip)
- Linux (ARM chip)
- Linux (Intel/AMD chip)

If you are on a Windows machine, follow our [Windows guide](/installation#windows-guide) to set up a WSL developer environment and install Linux binaries.

## Nillion Clients

### General Limitations
- Three available clients: Python, JavaScript, and CLI
- Program compilation is restricted to CLI tools (`pynadac` or `nada`)
- Each client requires a unique node key to prevent timeout errors

### JavaScript Client Specifics
- Browser Support: 
  - Fully supported: Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge)
  - Limited support: Firefox, Safari
  - Not supported: Internet Explorer
- Security Requirements:
  - [COOP and COEP headers](https://web.dev/coop-coep/) for production deployments
  - Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
  - Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
- Environment Constraints:
  - Currently browser-only implementation
  - NodeJS support is planned for future releases
  - Web Workers are required for computation
- Performance Considerations:
  - Computation speed depends on browser capabilities
  - Memory usage scales with secret size
  - Network latency affects operation timing

### CLI Client and DevNet
- Performance depends on local hardware resources
- Network initialization requires 10-15 seconds for preprocessing (8192 alphas & lambdas)
- State Persistence: Data (programs, secrets) doesn't persist between devnet instances
- Transport: Currently limited to localhost

### One node key per client

- If you are instantiating multiple clients (users) at once (e.g. `Party1`, `Party2`, `Party3` for a multi party compute), ensure that each instantiated client uses a different node key. If a node key is reused, across clients, you will see a timeout error.

## Secrets

- Secrets are not yet user scoped.
- Continuously storing secrets in a loop can lead to errors due to the necessity of blinding factors for secret storage. Blinding factors are generated by the network on demand when a threshold is met. If secrets are stored continuously, the network may struggle to generate blinding factors in time.

## Nada language, programs, and inputs

Check the [Nada language docs](/nada-lang) for the current [data types](/nada-lang-types) and [operations](/nada-lang-operators) available.

### Current Limitations
1. No random value generation (planned for future releases)
2. Limited function composition due to scope management
3. No division by zero support
4. Simplified variable scope management

Example of unsupported function composition:
```python
# This will not work due to scope limitations
def inc(a: SecretInteger, my_int: SecretInteger) -> SecretInteger:
    return a + my_int

def inc2(a: SecretInteger) -> SecretInteger:
    return inc(a, SecretInteger(2))  # Error: inc is not accessible
```

## Network Participation

- Local development: Available through [nillion-devnet](/nillion-devnet)
- Testnet node operation: Currently permissioned
- Future plans: Transition to permissionless model
