# High Value Data (HVD)

High value data refers to data that is extremely valuable to an organization or individual due to its potential to significantly impact everyone’s lives – from AI to trading information (leverage and limit orders) to identity to healthcare data to access control to decentralized social to passwords to biometrics – high value data is woven into the infrastructure of our society.
