# Quickstart

With nilAI, it is possible to run AI models within a trusted execution environment (TEE) via the secretLLM SDK. This makes it possible to build new private AI applications or migrate existing ones to run on a secure nilAI node so that your data remains private.

## Getting Started

In this quickstart, we will interact with a private AI chat/response application via Next.js. Let's get started by cloning our examples repo.

```
gh repo clone NillionNetwork/blind-module-examples
cd blind-module-examples/nilai/secretllm_nextjs_nucs
```

## Authentication

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Now we need to set `NILLION_API_KEY` using a key from the Nillion Subscription Portal below.

<CTABanner
  question='Get your Nillion keys here'
  instruction='Visit the Nillion subscription portal to get your API keys for secretLLM!'
  buttonText='Get your keys'
  buttonLink='https://subscription.nillion.com'
  event='quickstart-sllm-cta-banner'
  external={true}
/>

## Usage

![secretLLM quickstart](/img/secretllm-quickstart.png)

We have two approaches for using the nilAI API via secretLLM:

- Direct API Access: Recommended for a solo developer/organization.
- Delegation Token: Provides permissions to another user or organization.

### Direct API Access

1. Get the API key from your `.env` file.
2. Check if the message and API key exist.
3. Initialize the nilAI OpenAI client with `baseURL`, `apiKey`, and `nilauthInstance`.
4. Make a request to the chat client with the `model` and `message`.
5. Receive the response from `message.content`.

```typescript reference showGithubLink
https://github.com/NillionNetwork/blind-module-examples/blob/main/nilai/secretllm_nextjs_nucs/app/api/chat/route.ts
```

### Delegation Token Access

1. Similar to Direct API access, except using `DELEGATION_TOKEN` authentication.
2. Server initializes a delegation token server.
3. Client produces a delegation request.
4. Server creates the delegation token.
5. Client uses the delegation token with the `model` and `message` for the request.
6. Response is delivered.

```typescript reference showGithubLink
https://github.com/NillionNetwork/blind-module-examples/blob/main/nilai/secretllm_nextjs_nucs/app/api/chat-delegation/route.ts
```

### Customization

You can also customize the types of models you want to use. Currently available models are listed [here.](./overview#available-models)

## What you've done

🎉 **Congratulations!** You just built and interacted with a privacy‑preserving LLM application:

1. **You (Builder)** get access to the secretLLM SDK.
2. **You (User)** can provide a prompt to the LLM.
3. **The LLM** understands your prompt and returns an answer via direct or delegated access.

This demonstrates a core principle of private AI: you can create endless private AI applications via Nillion.
