# Network API Access

The nilPay Subscription Portal allows you to subscribe and create credentials for using the [Private Storage](/blind-computer/build/storage/overview) and [Private LLMs](/blind-computer/build/llms/overview) network APIs.

This guide walks you through the process of creating an API key.

## Prerequisites
You must have acquired some Sepolia ETH + NIL via this [faucet guide.](/community/guides/testnet-faucet)

## Create an API Key

Open up the [nilPay Subscription Portal](https://subscription.nillion.com) to create an API key. Sign in via your desired EVM browser wallet.

## Connecting to Sepolia
Your EVM wallet should connect to the nilPay Portal. Select `Sepolia` for your desired network.

## Identity Options

The **Choose Recipient** step lets you decide which identity will have access to your nilDB and/or nilAI subscription. There are two categories:

| Category | Options | How it works |
|---|---|---|
| **Wallet-based** | My Wallet, Another Identity | Access is tied directly to an Ethereum address. Use **My Wallet** for your connected address, or **Another Identity** to grant access to a different Ethereum address. |
| **Key-based** | Generate New Identity, Import Secret Key | Works like a standard API key approach — a Secp256k1 private key authenticates your requests directly. Use **Generate New Identity** to create a new key, or **Import Secret Key** to reuse an existing one. The key is associated with your Ethereum address at creation time. |

:::note
        Your address may appear as `did:ethr:0xXXX`. This is a DID (Decentralized Identifier) — a unique cryptographic identifier derived from your public key, used for verifiable authentication.

<TabItem value='nilDB' label='Private Storage' default>

For nilDB, all four identity options are available — both wallet-based and key-based.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='nilAI' label='Private LLM' default>

For nilAI, only key-based options are supported: **Generate New Identity** or **Import Secret Key**. This works like a standard API key approach — your secret key authenticates requests directly. Do not lose your Secret Key.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Subscription to nilAI and/or nilDB

You have the required NIL from the [prerequisite](#prerequisite) / [testnet faucet](https://faucet.testnet.nillion.network/), so you should be able to subscribe to either of the services.

Click on the either `Purchase` for `nilDB` or `nilAI` to subscribe and follow the wallet prompts.

After the payment goes through, you will have a 28 day subscription to the service and can now use your keys.
