# TypeScript Client

The TypeScript client `client-ts` provides libraries for interacting with Nillion blind compute networks. This client is structured as a monorepo containing multiple packages to support different use cases and environments.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started with Nillion is using the create-nillion-app cli tool, which spins up a working Next.js app

```bash
npx @nillion/create-nillion-app@latest
```

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Nillion Quickstart Demo"
    sources={{
        light: '/img/nillion_quickstart_demo_light.png',
        dark: '/img/nillion_quickstart_demo_dark.png',
      }}
  />

</div>

## Manual Installation

### Install Nillion SDK

If you have not already, in your shell/terminal run the following command to install the Nillion SDK.

```bash
curl https://nilup.nilogy.xyz/install.sh | bash
```

Then ensure that you can run the `nillion-devnet --seed test` command in a separate terminal. Please refer to the [Installation guide](./installation) for further information.

### Install the JavaScript Client

Install the following packages in your browser application (i.e. React / Nextjs). The Nillion client is composed of three main packages:

- **_@nillion/client-wasm_**: Collection of utility functions exported from Rust to WebAssembly, providing core functionality for the Nillion ecosystem.
- **_@nillion/client-vms_**: Primary gRPC client that combines payments and network operations into a simple API. This package supports both web browsers and Node.js environments.
- **_@nillion/client-react-hooks_**: React hooks built on top of @nillion/client-vms and integrated with @tanstack/react-query for seamless React application development.

## Usage

This is the barebones initialization needed to start the NillionProvider. You must be running `nillion-devnet` in another terminal to be able to interact with this.

The approach we take is to:

1. Import NillionProvider + createClient
2. Set the client when mounted with UseEffect
3. Initialized!

_Please note this is based on Next.js so can differ._

```typescript
// page.tsx

'use client';

import { NillionProvider, createClient } from '@nillion/client-react-hooks';
import type { VmClient } from '@nillion/client-vms';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function Home() {
  const [client, setClient] = useState<VmClient>();

  useEffect(() => {
    const init = async () => {
      const client = await createClient({
        network: 'devnet',
      });
      setClient(client);
    };
    void init();
  }, []);

  if (!client) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return <NillionProvider client={client}>...</NillionProvider>;
}
```

### Updating our next.config.ts

We also want to update our `next.config.ts` to be able to interact with the Nillion WASM client, hence the overrides. So replace your empty config with the following settings.

```tsx reference showGithubLink
https://github.com/NillionNetwork/client-ts/blob/main/examples-nextjs/next.config.mjs
```

## Next Steps

Now you can interact with the Nillion devnet and use the React hooks to do various storage and compute actions with the network.

And once you are ready for testnet, you can follow these [testnet instructions.](./quickstart-testnet.md)
