# Your first steps with Nillion

👋 Hey, welcome to [Nillion](https://docs.nillion.com/).

This page will help you take your first steps (~30 mins) as a Nillion developer. Once you have completed them, fill out the form for your chance to claim your $20 prize - each week we will review the submissions and pick the best to receive a prize 🎉

1. Star & fork either the [Python](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nillion-python-starter) or [JavaScript](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/cra-nillion) quickstart repos (bonus points for both)

   🚨 Add the topic `nillion-nada` to this repo so we can find it easily

2. Follow at least one of the quickstarts: [Python Quickstart](/python-quickstart) or [JavaScript Blind App Quickstart](/quickstart)

   🚨 Make sure you [enable telemetry](/nillion-sdk-and-tools#installation) as you install the Nillion SDK

3. Once you have completed the quickstart, add at least one new [nada program](/nada-lang-programs) to your repo (bonus points for creativity, but make sure it compiles and runs)

   - Python quickstart: add your nada program in your repo's [programs](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nillion-python-starter/tree/main/programs) folder
   - JavaScript quickstart: add your program in your repo's [public/programs](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/cra-nillion/tree/main/public/programs) folder
