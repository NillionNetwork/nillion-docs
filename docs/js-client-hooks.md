# Hooks
Hooks are functions that help you easily read/write into Nillion network and interact with Nada Programs. Our [examples/nextjs](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/client-ts/tree/main/examples-nextjs) have all of these as components to better understand how to interact with them.

To best understand how Nillion functions, it provides two main focuses:
1. Storage of [values](./js-client-hooks-values.md) and retreiving them
2. Blind [computation](./js-client-hooks-compute.md) powered by MPC with Nada Programs. 

[Permissions](./js-client-hooks-permissions.md) are added ontop of the network to allow/restrict who can interact with the storage and compute.
