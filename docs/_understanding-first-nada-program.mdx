Let's go through the program line by line to understand what each part is doing. 

1. First we import all from nada_dsl, the Nada language
    ```python
   from nada_dsl import *
   ```
2. Next we create `function nada_main()` - this is the main function that contains our Nada program's code.
   ```python
   from nada_dsl import *
   
   def nada_main():
   ```
3. Create a party with a name: `Party1`
   ```python
   from nada_dsl import *
   
   def nada_main():
   
       party1 = Party(name="Party1")
   ```

   This is a single party program, but you could add more than one party; for example we could define `party2 = Party(name="Party2")`.
4. Create program inputs
   ```python
   from nada_dsl import *
   
   def nada_main():
   
       party1 = Party(name="Party1")
   
       my_int1 = SecretInteger(Input(name="my_int1", party=party1))
   
       my_int2 = SecretInteger(Input(name="my_int2", party=party1))
   ```
   
   This program has two inputs, both secret integers. Each input must have a `name` and a `party` associated with it. Currently in nada you can only compute on secret or public integers (and rationals by using the `nada-algebra` library).

5. Compute on the inputs
   ```python
   from nada_dsl import *
   
   def nada_main():
   
       party1 = Party(name="Party1")
   
       my_int1 = SecretInteger(Input(name="my_int1", party=party1))
   
       my_int2 = SecretInteger(Input(name="my_int2", party=party1))
   
       new_int = my_int1 + my_int2
   ```
   This performs addition to sum the inputs. Check out all the [built in operations available in nada here](/nada-lang-operators).

6. Return the output of the program
   ```python
   from nada_dsl import *
   
   def nada_main():
   
       party1 = Party(name="Party1")
   
       my_int1 = SecretInteger(Input(name="my_int1", party=party1))
   
       my_int2 = SecretInteger(Input(name="my_int2", party=party1))
   
       new_int = my_int1 + my_int2
   
       return [Output(new_int, "my_output", party1)]
   ```
   To output the result of a program, we must provide a name - in this case `my_output` - and a party to whom the output is provided - in this case `party1`.
