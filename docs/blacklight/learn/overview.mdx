# Blacklight (Coming Soon)

Nillion Blacklight is the verification layer of the Blind Computer. It is powered by [Nillion's Ethereum L2](/blacklight/verify/network) and a decentralized network of permissionless, community-run Blacklight nodes that continuously challenge and verify workloads running on [nilCC](/blind-computer/build/compute/overview) and other TEE providers (such as Phala and Secret Network).

Nillion Blacklight will be released very soon. You can read about its [architecture](/blacklight/learn/architecture), [verficiation protocol](/blacklight/learn/verification), and details about how [staking and rewards](/blacklight/learn/staking-and-rewards) work.


{/* ## Start Verifying

Start earning rewards by verifying existing apps &mdash; or let Blacklight's node operators verify your own apps &mdash; using Blacklight's features and tools.

## Components

Nillion Blacklight has three main components.

- [**Community-run Blacklight Nodes**](/blacklight/verify/run-node): Permissionless nodes that verify TEE workloads by challenging attestation reports and monitoring enclave behavior.

- [**Nillion's Ethereum L2**](/blacklight/verify/network): An EVM-compatible Layer 2 network that handles verification work assignment, staking, and reward distributions.

- [**Smart Contracts**](/blacklight/verify/contracts): Solidity contracts that handle protocol configuration, manage staking, select verification committees, orchestrate verification, and distribute rewards.

Together, the above components form a credibly neutral trust layer that holds applications with TEE workloads accountable through continuous monitoring and verification.

## Scope and Vision

Nillion Blacklight can currently verify the two categories of workloads below.

- Workloads running on Nillion's confidential compute module [nilCC](/blind-computer/build/compute/overview) that have opted-in to verification.
- Phala workloads registered with Blacklight.

The vision behind Nillion Blacklight is that, over time, it will become a universal, credibly neutral TEE trust layer that enables workload verification across many TEE providers. */}
