# Running a Node Prerequisites

Before setting up your Blacklight node you need to make sure you have the following:
1. NIL on Nillion's Ethereum L2 (<b>70,000 NIL</b> must be staked to a node for it to be assigned work)
2. ETH on Nillion's Ethereum L2 (to pay for gas on Nillion's L2 - we recommend funding the node with between <b>0.0001 ETH and 0.001 ETH</b>)

This section will show you how to achieve both. You will need to hold both NIL and ETH on Ethereum. 
To obtain NIL, you can either bridge your Cosmos NIL 
([see here for details](/blacklight/tools/bridging#from-cosmos-to-ethereum)) or buy or swap to NIL 
on a decentralised exchange, for example Uniswap.

    <p>To bridge `NIL` tokens from Ethereum to Nillion's L2:</p>
    
    1. Visit [Nillion's Mainnet Bridge](https://bridge.nillion.network/)
    2. Connect your wallet
    3. Ensure `Ethereum` is the source chain and `Nillion` is the destination
    4. Select `NIL` as the token to bridge
    5. Enter the amount of `NIL` you want to bridge
    6. Review and confirm the transaction
    
    <p>Your NIL tokens will be available on Nillion's L2 after the bridge transaction is confirmed.</p>

To see the bridged assets in your wallet, you may need to add Nillion's L2 as a <b>network</b> and add the <b>token</b> in your 
wallet. Check out the network configuration details and token contract addresses on 
the [Network Configuration page](/blacklight/learn/network#mainnet).
