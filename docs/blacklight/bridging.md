## From Cosmos to Ethereum

You can bridge NIL tokens from nilChain (Cosmos) to Ethereum using the Skip Go bridge.

### Bridge NIL from Cosmos

The [Skip Go](https://go.skip.build/?src_asset=unil&src_chain=nillion-1&dest_asset=0x7Cf9a80db3B29eE8efE3710AadB7b95270572d47&dest_chain=1&amount_in=&amount_out=) bridge allows you to transfer NIL between nilChain (Cosmos) and Ethereum.

To bridge NIL from Cosmos to Ethereum:

1. Visit the [Skip Go bridge](https://go.skip.build/?src_asset=unil&src_chain=nillion-1&dest_asset=0x7Cf9a80db3B29eE8efE3710AadB7b95270572d47&dest_chain=1&amount_in=&amount_out=)
2. Connect your wallet (supports both Cosmos and EVM wallets)
3. The source chain (nilChain `nillion-1`), destination chain (Ethereum `1`), source asset (NIL), source asset, and destination asset are pre-populated from the link
4. Enter the amount of NIL you want to bridge
5. Review and confirm the transaction

The bridge will handle the cross-chain transfer and your NIL tokens will be available on Ethereum once the transaction is complete.
