# Register Apps for Verification

App developers can register their Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) workloads with the Blacklight network to have them continuously verified. This provides accountability and trust for your applications by ensuring they run correctly within secure enclaves.

## Supported Platforms

Blacklight currently verifies workloads running on:

- **nilCC** (Nillion's Confidential Compute) - Nillion's TEE compute infrastructure
- **Phala Network** - Phala TEE workloads registered with Blacklight

## Register nilCC Workloads
