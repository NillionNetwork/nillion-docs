# Run a Verifier Node

Anyone in the community can run a permissionless Blacklight verifier node. Verifier nodes continuously challenge and verify Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) workloads, helping to ensure the security and correctness of applications running on the Blind Computer.

By running a verifier node, you contribute to the network's security while earning rewards.

## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up and running a Blacklight verifier node.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Docker** installed and running on your machine
- A wallet with sufficient **ETH** (minimum 0.00001 ETH for gas fees)
- **NIL tokens** for staking (minimum 70 NIL, recommended 5,000+ NIL)

## Step 1: Select Platform & Install Docker

Choose your operating system for platform-specific setup instructions:

- **macOS**
- **Linux**
- **Windows**


Docker is required to run the Nillion verifier node.

> **Note:** After installation, you may need to restart your terminal.

## Step 2: Setup & Run Node

Pull the Docker image, run it to generate your node wallet, and enter the node's wallet address.

### Pull Docker Image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/nillionnetwork/niluv/niluv_node:latest
```

### Run Node Setup

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v ./niluv_node:/app/ -v ./niluv_node:/tmp/niluv-cache ghcr.io/nillionnetwork/niluv/niluv_node:latest --rpc-url https://rpc-nilav-shzvox0915.t.conduit.xyz --manager-contract-address 0x8d683fb2CC794E085E8366c4f28f8CC991107576 --staking-contract-address 0x595A112FA10ED66Bc518b28781035BA50C9f2216 --token-contract-address 0x69AD6D3E17C99A3f66b5Ae410a5D1D4E14C7da35
```

> **Note:** On first run, the node will generate a new wallet and save it to `./niluv_node/niluv_node.env`. Your wallet address will be displayed — copy it for the next field.

### Enter Node Address

After running the setup command, you'll see output similar to:

```
INFO niluv::config::node: No private key found. Generating new wallet...
INFO niluv::config::node: New wallet generated and saved to niluv_node.env
INFO niluv::config::node: Address: 0xe494fbb8c35fe399b1e550c19787807633978c20
```

Copy this address — you'll need it for staking in the next step.

## Step 3: Fund Your Node

Your node wallet needs both ETH (for gas) and NIL tokens (for staking).

### Requirements

| Asset | Minimum | Recommended |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| ETH | 0.00001 ETH | 0.01+ ETH |
| NIL | 70 NIL | 5,000+ NIL |


## Step 4: Stake NIL Tokens

Once your waller is funded, stake NIL tokens to activate it.

1. Go to the **Stake** tab in the Node Details dashboard
2. Enter the amount to stake (minimum 70 NIL)
3. Click **Stake Tokens**
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

After staking, your node status will change to **ACTIVE**.

## Step 5: Start Node

Run the node binary to register and start your verifier node.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v ./niluv_node:/app/ -v ./niluv_node:/tmp/niluv-cache ghcr.io/nillionnetwork/niluv/niluv_node:latest --rpc-url https://rpc-nilav-shzvox0915.t.conduit.xyz --manager-contract-address 0x8d683fb2CC794E085E8366c4f28f8CC991107576 --staking-contract-address 0x595A112FA10ED66Bc518b28781035BA50C9f2216 --token-contract-address 0x69AD6D3E17C99A3f66b5Ae410a5D1D4E14C7da35
```

After running this command, you should see "Node registered successfully" in your terminal. This means your node is successfully running and ready to receive verification work.

## Node Dashboard

Once your node is running, you can monitor it.

### Dashboard Tabs

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Verification Activity** | View committee assignments and verification tasks |
| **Stake** | Add more NIL tokens to your stake |
| **Unstake** | Request to unstake tokens (unbonding period applies) |
| **Withdraw** | Withdraw unstaked tokens after unbonding |
| **Rewards** | Claim your earned NIL rewards |
| **Fund Node** | Send additional ETH or NIL to your node |

### Node Status

Your node will display one of the following statuses:

- **ACTIVE** — Node is registered and ready for verification work
- **INACTIVE** — Node is not staked or has insufficient balance
- **PENDING** — Node registration is being processed

## Claiming Rewards

As your node participates in verification activities, you'll earn NIL rewards.

1. Navigate to the **Rewards** tab
2. View your **Staker Claimable** balance
3. Click **Claim Rewards** to transfer earnings to your wallet

> **Note:** There may be no rewards to claim if your node hasn't been selected for committee verification yet. Committee assignments appear on the Verification Activity tab.

## Unstaking

To unstake your NIL tokens:

1. Go to the **Unstake** tab
2. Enter the amount to unstake
3. Click **Request Unstake**

> **Note:** Unstaking initiates an unbonding period. You can withdraw tokens after the period ends.

## Troubleshooting

### Node requires funding

If you see:

```
Please fund this address with at least 0.00001 ETH and stake NIL tokens to continue
```

Your node wallet needs ETH to work. 

### No verification activity

New nodes may not immediately receive committee assignments. Continue running your node — assignments will appear as the network schedules verification work.

### Docker permission errors

On Linux, you may need to add your user to the docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Then log out and back in for changes to take effect.
