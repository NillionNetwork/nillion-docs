# Prerequisites

Before setting up your Blacklight node you need to make sure you have the following:
1. NIL on Nillion's Ethereum L2 (at least 70k NIL to stake for your node to be assigned work)
2. ETH on Nillion's Ethereum L2 (to pay for gas on Nillion's L2)

This section will show you how to achieve both. You will need to hold both NIL and ETH on Ethereum. To obtain NIL, you can either bridge your Cosmos ETH ([see here for details](/blacklight/tools/bridging#from-cosmos-to-ethereum)) or buy or swap to NIL on a decentralised exchange, for example Uniswap.

## Bridge NIL from Ethereum

To bridge `NIL` tokens from Ethereum to Nillion's L2:

1. Visit [Nillion's Mainnet Bridge](https://bridge.nillion.network/)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Ensure `Ethereum` is the source chain and `Nillion` is the destination
4. Select `NIL` as the token to bridge
5. Enter the amount of `NIL` you want to bridge
6. Review and confirm the transaction

Your NIL tokens will be available on Nillion's L2 after the bridge transaction is confirmed. To see the bridged assets in your wallet, you may need to add Nillion's L2 as a network and add the token in your wallet - you can find network configuration details and token contract addresses on the [Network Configuration page](/blacklight/verify/network).


## Bridge ETH from Ethereum

To bridge `ETH` from Ethereum to Nillion's L2:

1. Visit [Nillion's Mainnet Bridge](https://bridge.nillion.network/)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Ensure `Ethereum` is the source chain and `Nillion` is the destination
4. Enter the amount of `ETH` you want to bridge
5. Review and confirm the transaction

Once the bridge transaction is confirmed, your ETH will be available on Nillion's L2.
